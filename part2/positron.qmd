# Positron

Positron is a data science IDE built by Posit (formerly RStudio) on top of VS Code. It combines the power of VS Code with native support for R and Python data science workflows.

## Why Positron?

- **Dual language support**: First-class support for both R and Python
- **Data viewer**: Inspect dataframes and tibbles interactively
- **Variable explorer**: See all objects in your environment
- **Integrated terminal**: Run shell commands without leaving the IDE
- **Extensions**: Access the VS Code extension ecosystem

## Key Interface Elements

### The Console

The console at the bottom shows your R or Python session. You can:

- Run code interactively
- See output and errors
- Switch between R and Python sessions

### The Environment Pane

Shows all variables in your current session:

- Dataframes with row/column counts
- Click to view data in the Data Viewer
- See memory usage

### The Data Viewer

Click any dataframe to open it in a spreadsheet-like viewer:

- Sort by columns
- Filter rows
- Search for values

## Essential Keyboard Shortcuts

| Action | macOS | Windows |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Run current line | Cmd+Enter | Ctrl+Enter |
| Run selection | Cmd+Enter | Ctrl+Enter |
| Open command palette | Cmd+Shift+P | Ctrl+Shift+P |
| Toggle terminal | Cmd+` | Ctrl+` |
| Quick file open | Cmd+P | Ctrl+P |
| Save file | Cmd+S | Ctrl+S |

## Working with R

Positron detects R automatically. Start an R session by:

1. Opening an `.R` file
2. Clicking "Start R" in the status bar
3. Running R code in the terminal

### Sending Code to Console

Select code and press **Cmd+Enter** (macOS) or **Ctrl+Enter** (Windows) to run it.

## Working with Python

### Selecting an Interpreter

1. Open Command Palette (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P)
2. Type "Python: Select Interpreter"
3. Choose your conda environment

NOTE: if you just initalized your conda environment you will need to restart Positron to see it as an option.

### Jupyter-style Execution

Python files support `# %%` cell markers for interactive execution:

```python
# %%
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")

# %%
df.describe()
```

Run cells with Shift+Enter.

## Recommended Extensions

Positron comes with many extensions pre-installed. Consider adding:

- **GitLens**: Enhanced Git integration
- **Rainbow CSV**: Color-code CSV columns
- **Quarto**: If you use Quarto documents

Install extensions via the Extensions panel (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+X).

## Project Settings

Create a `.vscode/settings.json` file for project-specific settings:

```json
{
  "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "~/miniforge3/envs/my-project/bin/python",
  "r.rpath.mac": "/usr/local/bin/R",
  "files.autoSave": "afterDelay"
}
```

## Tips for Effective Use

1. **Use the Command Palette**: Press Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P to access any command
2. **Learn keyboard shortcuts**: They significantly speed up your workflow
3. **Split the editor**: View multiple files side by side
4. **Use integrated terminal**: Keep everything in one window

## Troubleshooting

### R not detected

- Ensure R is installed and in your PATH
- Check Positron settings for R path configuration

### Python environment not showing

- Activate the conda environment in the terminal first
- Use "Python: Select Interpreter" to manually choose it

### Slow performance

- Close unused tabs
- Restart Positron
- Check if large data is loaded in memory
