# Git & GitHub

## What is Git?

Git is a **version control system**—software that tracks every change you make to your files over time. Think of it as an unlimited undo history for your entire project, with the ability to see exactly what changed, when, and why.

Without version control, projects tend to accumulate files like this:

```
analysis_v1.R
analysis_v2.R
analysis_v2_final.R
analysis_v2_final_FINAL.R
analysis_v2_final_FINAL_fixed.R
```

With Git, you have one file (`analysis.R`) and a complete history of every version. You can:

- **See what changed**: Compare any two versions to see exactly which lines were added, removed, or modified
- **Understand why**: Each saved version includes a message explaining the change
- **Go back in time**: Restore any previous version if something breaks
- **Work in parallel**: Create "branches" to experiment without affecting your main code
- **Collaborate safely**: Multiple people can work on the same project without overwriting each other

Git runs locally on your computer. Every project folder that Git tracks is called a **repository** (or "repo"). The history lives in a hidden `.git` folder inside your project.

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a **website that hosts Git repositories online**. Git and GitHub are related but different:

| Git | GitHub |
|-----|--------|
| Software on your computer | Website (github.com) |
| Tracks file history locally | Stores repos in the cloud |
| Works offline | Requires internet |
| Free, open-source tool | Company (owned by Microsoft) |

You can use Git without GitHub—the history stays on your computer. But GitHub adds important capabilities:

- **Backup**: Your code is safe even if your laptop dies
- **Collaboration**: Others can access, download, and contribute to your project
- **Visibility**: Share your work publicly or keep it private
- **Project management**: Issues, pull requests, and documentation

Other Git hosting services exist (GitLab, Bitbucket), but GitHub is the most common in science and the one we use in the lab.

## Personal Accounts vs. the Lab Organization

On GitHub, you have a **personal account** (your username), and you can also belong to **organizations** (shared accounts for teams).

The lab uses the **MusserLab** organization for all research projects. Here's how to think about where your repos should live:

| Where | When to use | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Your personal account** | Personal projects only: coursework, side projects, learning exercises | `jsmith/practice-git`, `jsmith/coursework` |
| **MusserLab organization** | All lab research—no exceptions | `MusserLab/tryptamine-phospho`, `MusserLab/rnaseq-pipeline` |

::: {.callout-important}
### Lab research belongs on the organization
If a project involves lab research, it must be on the MusserLab organization—not your personal account. This ensures continuity when people leave, makes collaboration possible, and keeps lab work in one place.
:::

### Visibility: Public vs. Private

Both personal accounts and organizations can have public or private repos:

- **Private**: Only you (or organization members) can see it
- **Public**: Anyone on the internet can see it

Lab research repos are typically kept **private**. When a paper is published, we usually create a separate, curated public repository with cleaned-up code and documentation—rather than making the working repo public. This lets you work freely during research without worrying about how messy your commit history looks.

### Adding Collaborators

To give someone access to your repo:

1. Go to your repo on GitHub
2. **Settings** → **Collaborators and teams**
3. Click **Add people**
4. Enter their GitHub username
5. Choose their permission level:
   - **Read**: Can view and clone, but not push changes
   - **Write**: Can push changes (use this for active collaborators)
   - **Admin**: Full control including settings (rarely needed)

## Why We Use Git for All Research

In the lab, we use Git for all research projects—think of it as the computational equivalent of a lab notebook. Your commit history becomes a record of how your analysis evolved: what you tried, what you changed, and why.

This practice pays off in several ways:

1. **A record of your work**: Every commit documents what you did and when, which helps with scientific integrity and your own memory
2. **Safety net**: Experiment freely knowing you can always go back if something breaks
3. **Backup**: Combined with GitHub, your work survives laptop failures and accidental deletions
4. **Reproducibility**: Collaborators (and future you) can trace exactly what code produced which results

You don't need to master every Git feature—the basics go a long way. The next sections cover what you need for daily work.

## Key Concepts

Before using Git, understand these core ideas:

**Repository (repo)**
: A project folder that Git is tracking. Contains a hidden `.git` folder that stores the entire history.

**Commit**
: A snapshot of your project at a moment in time. Each commit has a unique ID (like `a1b2c3d`), a message describing what changed, and a pointer to the previous commit. Commits form a chain—your project's history.

**Staging area**
: A holding area for changes you want to include in your next commit. You "stage" files first, then "commit" them. This two-step process lets you commit only some of your changes.

**Branch**
: A parallel version of your project. The default branch is called `main`. You can create other branches to experiment without affecting `main`, then merge them back when ready.

**Remote**
: A copy of your repository on another server—typically GitHub. Your local repo and the remote stay in sync through pushing (uploading your commits) and pulling (downloading others' commits).

## The Daily Workflow in Positron

Most of your Git usage follows this pattern: edit files, stage changes, commit with a message, and push to GitHub. Positron's **Source Control panel** makes this straightforward without needing to use the command line.

### Opening Source Control

Click the **branch icon** in the left sidebar, or use **Cmd+Shift+G** (macOS) / **Ctrl+Shift+G** (Windows). You'll see:

- **Changes**: Files you've modified since the last commit
- **Staged Changes**: Files ready to be committed

### The Basic Cycle

**1. Make changes to your files**

Work normally—edit scripts, add new files, delete things you don't need. Git tracks everything automatically.

**2. Review what changed**

Open the Source Control panel. You'll see a list of changed files under "Changes." Click any file to see a **diff view** showing exactly what lines were added (green) or removed (red).

**3. Stage files for commit**

Click the **+** icon next to each file you want to include in your commit. The file moves from "Changes" to "Staged Changes."

::: {.callout-tip}
### Be intentional about staging
You don't have to stage everything at once. If you made unrelated changes to several files, you can commit them separately with different messages. This keeps your history cleaner and easier to understand.
:::

**4. Write a commit message and commit**

Type a message in the text box at the top of the Source Control panel. Then click the **checkmark** (✓) to commit.

**5. Push to GitHub**

Click the **three-dot menu** (⋯) and select **Push**, or click the sync icon in the status bar. Until you push, your commits exist only on your computer.

**6. Pull before starting work**

If you're collaborating or working from multiple computers, always pull before you start making changes. Click the three-dot menu → **Pull** to download any new commits from GitHub.

### What the Icons Mean

In the Source Control panel, you'll see letters next to changed files:

- **M** (Modified): An existing file was changed
- **U** (Untracked): A new file Git hasn't seen before
- **D** (Deleted): A file was removed
- **A** (Added): A new file that's been staged

## Writing Good Commit Messages

Commit messages are part of your scientific record. Write them for future-you (and collaborators) who need to understand what changed and why.

**Bad messages:**
```
update
fix
changes
asdf
```

These tell you nothing. Six months later, you won't remember what "update" meant.

**Good messages:**
```
Add QC step to filter samples with <1000 genes detected
Fix off-by-one error causing last sample to be dropped
Update normalization to use SCTransform instead of LogNormalize
Remove outlier samples identified in PCA (samples 12, 47)
```

These explain *what* changed and often *why*. When you look at the history, you can understand the evolution of your analysis.

### When to Commit

Commit when you've completed a logical unit of work:

- Finished a new analysis step
- Fixed a bug
- Added a new figure
- Made a decision you want to record

Don't wait until the end of the day to make one giant commit. Small, focused commits are easier to understand and easier to undo if needed.

## Setting Up .gitignore

The `.gitignore` file tells Git which files to ignore—they won't be tracked or committed. This is essential for:

- **Large files**: Data files that are too big for Git
- **Generated files**: Outputs that can be recreated from code
- **Secrets**: Credentials that should never be shared
- **System junk**: OS and IDE files that aren't part of your project

### Standard .gitignore for Lab Projects

```
# Large data files (add specific patterns as needed)
*.h5ad
*.rds
*.csv

# Generated outputs (reproducible from code)
outs/

# R artifacts
.Rhistory
.RData
.Rproj.user/
renv/library/

# Python artifacts
__pycache__/
*.pyc
.venv/

# Quarto rendering
*_files/
*_cache/
.quarto/

# Secrets - NEVER commit these
.env
*credentials*
*secret*

# OS files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# IDE settings (optional - some teams share these)
.vscode/
.positron/
```

::: {.callout-important}
### Create .gitignore first
Set up `.gitignore` before your first commit. Once a file is committed, adding it to `.gitignore` won't remove it from history—it's already tracked.
:::

## Getting a Repository

### Cloning an Existing Repo

If a repository already exists on GitHub and you want to work on it:

1. Go to the repo on GitHub
2. Click the green **Code** button
3. Copy the HTTPS URL
4. In Positron, open the Command Palette (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P)
5. Type "Git: Clone" and paste the URL
6. Choose where to save it

Positron downloads the repository and opens it. You can immediately start working, committing, and pushing.

### Creating a New Repo

For a brand new project, the easiest approach is to create the repo on GitHub first:

1. Go to github.com and click **New repository**
2. Choose the MusserLab organization (for lab projects)
3. Name it, set visibility to Private, and check "Add a README"
4. Clone it to your computer using the steps above

This sets everything up correctly from the start.

## Beyond the Basics

The workflow above covers 90% of what you'll do with Git. But Git has powerful features for more complex situations. Here's what they are and when you might need them—you don't need to learn these now, but it helps to know they exist.

### Branches

A branch is a parallel version of your project. The main use case: you want to try something experimental without risking your working code. You create a branch, make changes there, and if it works, you merge it back into `main`. If it doesn't, you delete the branch and `main` is untouched.

Positron's Source Control panel shows your current branch in the status bar and lets you create and switch branches through the branch menu. For solo analysis work, you often don't need branches—committing directly to `main` is fine. Branches become more useful when collaborating or when you want to experiment with major changes.

### Merge Conflicts

Conflicts happen when two people change the same lines in a file, or when you have changes on two different computers that overlap. Git can't automatically decide which version to keep, so it asks you to resolve it manually.

When this happens, the conflicting file will show both versions with special markers. You edit the file to keep the version you want (or combine them), then commit the resolution. Positron highlights conflicts and provides tools to help resolve them.

Conflicts are less common than you might fear, especially on solo projects. Pull before you start working, and you'll rarely encounter them.

Claude Code can explain confusing Git messages and suggest safe next steps.

> Git is showing me this and I'm not sure what to do: `Your branch and 'origin/main' have diverged, and have 2 and 3 different commits each, respectively.` What does this mean and how do I fix it?

Claude will explain the situation in plain language (your local and remote branches have different changes) and walk you through resolving it safely, typically with `git pull --rebase` or a merge.
:::

### Undoing Mistakes

Git provides ways to undo changes at every stage:

- **Before staging**: Discard changes to a file, reverting to the last committed version
- **After staging but before committing**: Unstage files while keeping your changes
- **After committing**: Undo the last commit (keeping the changes) or amend it with corrections
- **After pushing**: This is trickier—changes are on the server. Usually you make a new commit that reverses the problematic one.

The Source Control panel provides options for discarding and unstaging changes. More complex undo operations (like reverting commits) are available through the Command Palette or by asking for help.

### Pull Requests

Pull requests (PRs) are GitHub's way of proposing changes for review before merging them. Instead of committing directly to `main`, you create a branch, push it to GitHub, and open a PR. Others can review the changes and discuss before merging.

For solo work, PRs are optional. They're most valuable when you want someone else to review your code before it becomes part of the main project, or when you want a clear record of when and why a set of changes was merged.

## Learning More

This chapter covers what you need to use Git effectively in your daily work. If you want to go deeper—learning command-line Git, understanding how Git works internally, or mastering advanced workflows—these resources are excellent:

- **[Pro Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)**: The comprehensive, free reference. Covers everything from basics to internals.
- **[GitHub Docs: Using Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git)**: Practical guides focused on common tasks.

## Best Practices Summary

**Commit often, push regularly**
: Small commits are easier to understand. Pushing backs up your work.

**Pull before you start working**
: Especially on shared projects—get others' changes before you start.

**Write meaningful commit messages**
: Future-you will thank present-you.

**Use .gitignore from the start**
: Prevent large files and secrets from ever entering the repo.

**Don't panic**
: Git rarely loses data. Most mistakes are recoverable—ask for help if you get stuck.
