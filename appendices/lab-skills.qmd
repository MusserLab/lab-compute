# Lab Skills Reference {#sec-lab-skills}

This appendix lists all Claude Code skills available in the Musser Lab toolkit. Install them from [MusserLab/lab-claude-skills](https://github.com/MusserLab/lab-claude-skills) — see [The Musser Lab Toolkit](../claude-code/musser-lab-toolkit.qmd) for installation instructions.

## Background Skills

Background skills load automatically based on context. You don't invoke them — Claude detects when they're relevant and follows their instructions.

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `data-handling` | Shows data dimensions after loading, validates joins, asks before analytical decisions |
| `debugging-before-patching` | Diagnoses root causes before fixing; never blind-patches symptoms |
| `file-safety` | Prevents overwriting raw data (`data/`) and important files |
| `git-conventions` | Co-author line in commits, reviews staged changes, avoids committing secrets |
| `conda-env` | Sources conda before activation (required in non-interactive shells) |
| `r-renv` | Explains renv warnings, reminds about `renv::snapshot()` after installs |
| `r-plotting-style` | Lab ggplot2 theme: `theme_classic()`, `ggrepel` labels, consistent sizing |
| `quarto-docs` | QMD analysis script conventions: status fields, git hash, `BUILD_INFO.txt` |
| `script-organization` | Numbered scripts (`01_`, `02_`), `outs/` directories, lifecycle status |
| `figure-export` | Publication-quality figure saving: PDF (`cairo_pdf`), PNG (300 DPI), SVG (`svglite`) |
| `scientific-manuscript` | Writing guidance for high-impact journals (narrative structure, prose style) |
| `protein-phylogeny` | Generates phylogenetics pipeline: MAFFT alignment, optional trimming, IQ-TREE |
| `gene-lookup` | Looks up gene/protein info from database IDs (UniProt, Ensembl, FlyBase, etc.) |
| `tree-formatting` | Phylogenetic tree visualization with ggtree: layout, coloring, clade collapsing |

## Slash Commands

Slash commands are invoked explicitly by typing `/command` in the Claude Code chat.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/done` | End-of-session wrap-up: summarize work, check renv, offer to commit |
| `/new-project` | Scaffold a complete project: directories, conda env, renv, CLAUDE.md, git |
| `/new-plan` | Create a planning document in `.claude/` and register it in CLAUDE.md |
| `/publish` | Commit changes and publish Quarto book/website to GitHub Pages |
| `/quarto-book-setup` | Initialize a new Quarto book project with GitHub Pages deployment |
| `/audit` | Project health check: cross-check docs, prune conventions, find drift |
| `/new-skill` | Create a new Claude Code skill with proper structure and description |
| `/security-setup` | Configure security protections for sensitive files and credentials |
