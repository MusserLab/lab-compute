Most lab projects use both R and Python: R is often best for statistical analysis, plotting, and many important legacy packages used for RNA sequencing and proteomic analysis (e.g. Seurat, DESeq2, and limma); Python is often best for automating analysis pipelines (including in bash), manipulating files, working with sequences and strings, and a growing number of RNAseq data analysis libraries (e.g. Scanpy, metacell) and plotting libraries (e.g. Matplotlib). The goal of this guide is to help you set up a standard workflow for creating computational projects that are well-managed, documented, collaborative, and reproducible.\nThe lab’s standard toolchain is:",

Use this while developing—you can inspect objects, test code, and debug interactively. The results appear in the console and plots pane.\nRendering (quarto render): Runs the entire document in a fresh R session and produces an HTML (or PDF/Word) output. Use this when you want a polished, shareable report. Because rendering starts fresh, it catches errors that might not appear interactively (like relying on objects you created earlier but forgot to include in the script).\nDuring development, work interactively. When you’re ready to share or commit, render the full document to ensure it runs cleanly from start to finish.",

    "text": "4.1 Why Positron?\nPositron is your home base. It’s where you write code, explore data, run analyses, and manage your project—all in one window. Built by Posit (the company behind RStudio) on top of VS Code, Positron combines the familiarity of RStudio with the power and extensibility of a modern code editor.\nIf you’re coming from RStudio, Positron will feel familiar: there’s an R console, a variable explorer, a data viewer, and a file browser. But Positron adds capabilities that matter for modern data science workflows:\nFirst-class support for both R and Python. Most lab projects use both languages. In RStudio, Python support is an afterthought. In Positron, both languages are treated equally—you can have R and Python sessions running side by side, each with its own console and environment viewer. In practice, we usually write one language per script (.qmd file), and Positron handles switching between them seamlessly.\nA superior Data Viewer. Click any dataframe in the Variables pane and it opens in a fast, interactive viewer. You can sort columns, filter rows, and search for values. For large datasets, it handles millions of rows smoothly. The Data Viewer is central to exploratory analysis—you’ll use it constantly.\nThe VS Code extension ecosystem. Positron inherits thousands of extensions: linters, formatters, Git tools, AI coding assistants. Unlike RStudio, which exists in its own world, Positron connects you to the broader developer tooling ecosystem.\nIf you’ve used RStudio before, see the RStudio → Positron translation table on the Welcome page for a quick mapping of concepts.\n[TODO: screenshot of Positron interface with labeled panes]",

    "section": "4.2 The Interface",
    "text": "4.2 The Interface\nPositron’s default layout will feel familiar if you’ve used RStudio: the editor sits in the main area, with supporting panels around it.\n\n4.2.1 Layout Overview\nThe typical arrangement is:\n\nEditor (center): Where you write and edit .qmd files, R scripts, Python scripts, and other documents\nConsole (bottom): Your R or Python session—run code interactively here\nTerminal (bottom, tabbed with Console): For shell commands, git, conda, quarto\nVariables/Environment (right or bottom): Shows objects in your current session\nExplorer (left sidebar): Browse files, see document outline, and navigate your project\nSearch (left sidebar): Find text across your entire project\nSource Control (left sidebar): Stage and commit changes with Git\n\nYou can rearrange panels by dragging them, but the default layout works well for most workflows.\n\n\n4.2.2 The Console\nThe console shows your active R or Python session. When you run code from the editor (with Cmd+Enter or Ctrl+Enter), the output appears here. You can also type commands directly into the console for quick exploration.\nKey points:\n\nYou can have both an R console and a Python console open simultaneously\nEach console shows the active interpreter/environment in the prompt\nThe console is where you see errors, warnings, and printed output\n\n\n\n4.2.3 The Variables Pane\nShows all objects in your current R or Python session:\n\nDataframes display with row and column counts\nClick any dataframe to open it in the Data Viewer\nVectors, lists, and other objects show their type and size\n\nThis pane is essential for keeping track of what’s in memory during interactive development.\n\n\n4.2.4 The Data Viewer\nThe Data Viewer is one of Positron’s standout features. Click any dataframe in the Variables pane to open it in a spreadsheet-like view where you can:\n\nSort by clicking column headers\nFilter rows by typing conditions\nSearch for specific values\nNavigate large datasets smoothly (it handles millions of rows)\n\nDuring exploratory analysis, you’ll have the Data Viewer open constantly—checking data after each transformation, looking for unexpected values, verifying that joins worked correctly.\n[TODO: screenshot of Data Viewer with a dataframe open]\n\n\n4.2.5 The Terminal\nThe integrated terminal gives you a command line inside Positron. Use it for:\n\nRunning quarto render or quarto preview\nGit commands (though the Source Control panel is often easier)\nConda environment management\nAny shell command you’d normally run in Terminal.app or Command Prompt\n\nToggle the terminal with Cmd+** (macOS) or **Ctrl+ (Windows).\n\n\n4.2.6 The Explorer\nThe Explorer panel (left sidebar) is your file browser and navigation hub. Click the file icon at the top of the sidebar to open it. It has several sections:\nFiles: Shows all files and folders in your project. Click to open, right-click for options (rename, delete, new file).\nOutline: This is especially useful for longer scripts. The Outline section shows the structure of your current document:\n\nFor .qmd files: headings, code chunks, and sections\nFor R/Python files: functions and class definitions\n\nClick any item in the Outline to jump directly to that section. When you’re working on a longer analysis script, the Outline makes it easy to navigate between sections without scrolling.\n\n\n4.2.7 Search\nThe Search panel (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+F) finds text across your entire project. Useful for:\n\nFinding where a function is defined or used\nSearching for variable names across files\nLocating specific text in your project\n\nClick the .* button to enable regular expressions for more powerful pattern matching. While not as full-featured as dedicated text editors like BBEdit, regex search handles most common patterns.\n\n\n4.2.8 Source Control\nThe Source Control panel in the left sidebar handles Git operations visually:\n\nSee which files have changed (modified, added, deleted)\nStage files for commit by clicking the + icon\nWrite a commit message and commit with one click\nPush and pull from GitHub\n\nEven if you end up using Claude Code for most git operations, understanding the Source Control panel is foundational. It shows you what’s happening with your repository at a glance.",

Understanding channels matters because the same package can exist in multiple channels with different versions or builds.\n\n5.6.1 Main Channels\n\nconda-forge: Community-maintained, comprehensive, well-tested. This is the primary channel for most scientific packages.\nbioconda: Bioinformatics tools (samtools, bedtools, bwa, etc.). Essential for genomics work.\ndefaults: Anaconda’s default channel. We generally avoid this in favor of conda-forge.\n\n\n\n5.6.2 Channel Priority\nWhen a package exists in multiple channels, conda uses channel priority to decide which version to install. We recommend strict priority with conda-forge first:\n# Configure strict channel priority (one-time setup)\nconda config --set channel_priority strict\nThis ensures conda-forge packages are always preferred, avoiding subtle version mismatches.\n\n\n5.6.3 Using Bioconda\nFor bioinformatics tools, add bioconda to your channels. The recommended order is:\n# Add channels in priority order (highest priority last)\nconda config --add channels defaults\nconda config --add channels bioconda\nconda config --add channels conda-forge\nThen install bioinformatics tools normally:\nconda install samtools bedtools\n\n\n5.6.4 Specifying Channels in environment.yml\nFor reproducibility, specify channels in your environment file:\nname: genomics-project\nchannels:\n  - conda-forge\n  - bioconda\n  - defaults\ndependencies:\n  - python=3.11\n  - pandas\n  - samtools\n  - bedtools\nThe order matters—channels listed first have higher priority.",

Use strict channel priority with conda-forge first.\nLoosen version constraints: If you’re requesting specific versions, try letting conda choose:\n# Instead of\nconda install pandas=1.5 numpy=1.24\n# Try\nconda install pandas numpy\nStart fresh: Sometimes it’s easier to recreate the environment:\nconda deactivate\nconda env remove -n my-project\nconda create -n my-project python=3.11 numpy pandas matplotlib ipykernel\n# Add other packages one at a time\nCheck bioconda compatibility: Some bioinformatics packages have strict dependencies. Check the package’s documentation for known issues.\n\n\n\n5.8.3 Package not found\n\nCheck spelling\nEnsure you have the right channels configured (conda-forge, bioconda)\nSearch for the package: conda search package-name\nFall back to pip if it’s not in conda\n\n\n\n5.8.4 macOS/Linux: “conda: command not found”\nYour shell isn’t configured for conda. Run:\nsource ~/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh\n# or if using Miniforge:\nsource ~/miniforge3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh\nTo make this permanent, add that line to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc file.\n\n\n5.8.5 Environment corrupted\nRemove and recreate:\nconda deactivate\nconda env remove -n my-project\nconda env create -f environment.yml\n\n\n5.8.6 Windows: “conda activate” does nothing or errors\nThis usually means conda isn’t initialized for your shell.

If you’re using VS Code or Positron’s integrated terminal, close and reopen the entire application.\n\n\n5.8.7 Windows: “conda is not recognized”\nThe Miniforge installer may not have added conda to your PATH.

If something's missing, update your `.claude/CLAUDE.md`.\n\n## Example: Real Project Configuration\n\nHere's an example from a genomics analysis project:\n\n```markdown\n# Project: Sponge Cell Atlas\n\n## Overview\n\nSingle-cell RNA-seq analysis of *Ephydatia muelleri* (freshwater sponge).\nGoal: identify cell types and marker genes.\n\n## Environment\n\n- Python: `conda activate sponge-atlas`\n- R: renv (Seurat 5.0, auto-activates)\n\n## Data\n\n- `data/raw/counts.h5ad` — AnnData object, 15,000 cells × 12,000 genes\n- `data/raw/metadata.csv` — Sample metadata (batch, condition)\n- Cell type annotations in `obs['cell_type']` (preliminary, needs refinement)\n\n## Analysis Scripts\n\n| Script | Purpose | Status |\n|--------|---------|--------|\n| `analysis/01_qc.qmd` | Quality control, filtering | Complete |\n| `analysis/02_clustering.qmd` | Dimensionality reduction, clustering | Complete |\n| `analysis/03_markers.qmd` | Marker gene identification | In progress |\n| `analysis/04_figures.qmd` | Publication figures | Not started |\n\n## Conventions\n\n- Use Seurat naming conventions (e.g., `FindMarkers`, not `find_markers`)\n- Cluster colors defined in `scripts/colors.R`\n- All figures 300 DPI, max 7 inches wide\n\n## Notes\n\n- Batch effect between samples 1-3 and 4-6; already corrected with Harmony\n- Cluster 7 is likely doublets—exclude from marker analysis",

Be specific about outputs\nInstead of “do QC,” specify exactly what you want: “histogram of total counts per sample.” Claude Code produces better results with clear requirements.\n\n\n13.8.3 3. Iterate based on results\nLook at the output, then refine. This mirrors how you’d work manually—but faster.\n\n\n13.8.4 4. Review before accepting\nAlways read the code Claude Code generates. Check that it: - Does what you asked - Handles edge cases appropriately - Follows your project conventions\n\n\n13.8.5 5.
