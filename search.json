Most lab projects use both R and Python: R is often best for statistical analysis, plotting, and many important legacy packages used for RNA sequencing and proteomic analysis (e.g. Seurat, DESeq2, and limma); Python is often best for automating analysis pipelines (including in bash), manipulating files, working with sequences and strings, and a growing number of RNAseq data analysis libraries (e.g. Scanpy, metacell) and plotting libraries (e.g. Matplotlib). The goal of this guide is to help you set up a standard workflow for creating computational projects that are well-managed, documented, collaborative, and reproducible.",

    "text": "1.2 How We Work in the Lab\nMost analysis in the Musser Lab is written in Quarto documents (.qmd files). A Quarto document is both a script, containing code chunks you can run interactively, as well as a report, which includes annotations that help readers (and yourself!) remember and understand what the code is doing. In addition to running code interactively, you can also render the Quarto document to produce a clean HTML (or PDF) document with your results, figures, and narrative included. This means your analysis and your documentation are always in sync, and there’s no separate step of copying figures into a report or updating numbers by hand.\nOur projects typically use both R and Python, though usually one language per script. R is used for statistical analysis, plotting, and the many well-established bioinformatics packages (Seurat, DESeq2, limma). Python was classically used for manipulating text files, working with sequence data, and running pipelines that manipulated files in bash. Increasingly, many modern single-cell and biological data science tools are being developed in Python. R remains essential for plenty of analyses, so lab members will need to be competent in both. Fortunately, Positron handles both languages equally well, so you can switch between them as needed.",

This is what makes your analysis reproducible—a collaborator (or future you) can run renv::restore() on another machine to install the exact same package versions. You’ll learn more about renv in the renv chapter.\nNow install the packages we need. We use renv::install() rather than install.packages() because it understands how to install packages from multiple sources—CRAN, Bioconductor, and GitHub:\nrenv::install(c(\"Seurat\", \"leidenbase\", \"ggplot2\", \"patchwork\", \"dplyr\", \"here\"))\nThis takes a few minutes—Seurat has many dependencies. The leidenbase package is needed for the Leiden clustering algorithm we’ll use later. Watch the console output as packages download and compile. When it’s done, save the state:\nrenv::snapshot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoterenv::install() and Bioconductor\n\n\n\nrenv::install() is the standard way to install packages in an renv project. For CRAN packages, just use the package name: renv::install(\"Seurat\"). For Bioconductor packages (common in genomics—DESeq2, SingleCellExperiment, etc.), prefix with bioc:::\nrenv::install(\"bioc::DESeq2\")\nAfter installing, always run renv::snapshot() to record the new packages in your lock file.",

The barcodes file has one entry per cell, the features file lists every gene, and the matrix file stores the actual counts in a compressed sparse format (most gene-cell combinations are zero, so this saves a lot of space).\nLook at the file explorer now.

The violin plots show the distribution of genes and UMI counts across all cells. You can resize the Plots pane by dragging its border, and use the navigation arrows to flip between plots as you make more.\n\n\n\nQC violin plots in the Plots pane\n\n\nHere’s what to look for in these plots:\nnCount_RNA (total UMI counts) varies naturally by cell type. Large cells or transcriptionally active cells capture more RNA, so higher counts don’t necessarily mean better quality. On the other hand, very high counts can indicate doublets—droplets that accidentally captured two cells during the 10X run, giving them roughly double the expected RNA content. Very low counts suggest empty droplets or dead cells.\nnFeature_RNA (genes detected) gives a sense of library complexity. A cell with very few detected genes may not have been captured well. Differences between samples are normal and can reflect both biology and technical variation.\nThis dataset has already been quality-filtered, so the distributions should look clean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipPop Out the Plots Pane\n\n\n\nIf you want a larger view of a plot, you can pop the Plots pane out into a separate window. Click the pop-out icon in the top-right corner of the Plots pane. This is especially useful for complex plots where you want to see fine detail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteQC Filtering in Practice\n\n\n\nWith raw, unfiltered data, you’d typically remove obvious junk cells—those with extremely low gene counts or extremely high counts that suggest doublets. But in practice, many experienced analysts set only very lenient thresholds at this stage, or none at all. The reason is that clustering itself is a powerful QC tool: cells with low-quality profiles often group together into their own “junk clusters” that you can remove later, after seeing how cells actually behave. This is more nuanced than applying hard cutoffs upfront, because some cells with low RNA counts are perfectly real (they’re just small or quiescent cells), and hard thresholds would throw them out.\nPrograms like DoubletFinder can also identify likely doublets computationally, which is more principled than a simple nCount_RNA threshold.",

    "text": "3.8 Step 4: Normalize and Find Variable Features\nRun the normalize chunk. This does two things.\n\n3.8.1 Normalization\nNormalizeData() adjusts for differences in sequencing depth between cells. It divides each cell’s gene counts by the cell’s total UMI count to get relative expression levels, then applies a log transformation. The log transformation addresses heteroscedasticity: without it, highly expressed genes would have much higher variance than lowly expressed genes, dominating downstream analyses.\nA word of caution: it’s often stated that differences in total RNA per cell are purely technical artifacts of sequencing depth. That can be true when comparing closely related cell types. But in whole-organism datasets like this one—where cells range from tiny pinacocytes to large, transcriptionally active archaeocytes—differences in total RNA abundance are genuinely biological. Normalization can flatten out real biology in these cases. This step is a useful default, but not a biological law.\nNot all methods even require this step. Casey Dunn and colleagues have developed approaches that work directly in count space, avoiding the assumptions baked into log-normalization. As you gain experience, it’s worth understanding what normalization does and when alternatives might be more appropriate.\nsponge &lt;- NormalizeData(sponge)\nsponge &lt;- FindVariableFeatures(sponge, selection.method = \"vst\", nfeatures = 2000)\n\n\n3.8.2 Variable features\nFindVariableFeatures() identifies the 2,000 genes whose expression varies most across cells. The idea is that genes expressed at similar levels in every cell don’t have much to say about the structure of the data—they won’t help distinguish cell types. By focusing on the most variable genes, the downstream analysis is more efficient and less noisy.\nThis is a reasonable heuristic, but it’s not the only approach. Methods like SAM (Self-Assembling Manifolds) take a different tack: they use all genes but weight them by how informative they are for finding structure, rather than discarding genes outright. The “select top 2,000 variable features” convention is one way to do this, not the only way.\nNow run the fig-variable-features chunk to visualize the results:\ntop10 &lt;- head(VariableFeatures(sponge), 10)\n\nplot1 &lt;- VariableFeaturePlot(sponge)\nplot2 &lt;- LabelPoints(plot = plot1, points = top10, repel = TRUE)\nplot2\nA new plot appears in the Plots pane showing genes ranked by variability.

Together with the log normalization from the previous step, this ensures that both lowly and highly expressed genes contribute equally to the analysis. PCA (Principal Component Analysis) then reduces the data from thousands of genes down to a smaller number of dimensions (principal components) that capture the main axes of variation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteA Note on Methods\n\n\n\nScaling followed by PCA is the standard Seurat workflow and a reasonable starting point for most datasets. Other approaches exist—for example, SAM (Self-Assembling Manifolds) skips the variable feature selection and PCA steps entirely and can work well, particularly for complex datasets. The Seurat pipeline is one well-established starting point, but it’s worth knowing that alternatives exist and may be better suited to your particular data.\n\n\nNow run the fig-elbow chunk to see the elbow plot:\nElbowPlot(sponge, ndims = 50)\nThe elbow plot shows how much variation each PC explains. We need to choose how many PCs to use for clustering. The “elbow”—where the curve flattens—gives a rough guide, but in practice we often include more PCs than the elbow alone might suggest. The reason: later PCs can capture variation from rare cell types that would be missed with too few dimensions. Using too few PCs has a real cost—clusters that should be separate may merge together, and you’ll miss biology. We’ll use 40 PCs for this dataset, which is deliberately generous.\n\n\n\nElbow plot in the Plots pane",

There are two complementary approaches, and you’ll typically use both.\n\n3.13.1 Approach 1: Unbiased differential expression\nWe can ask which genes are most enriched in a given cluster compared to all other cells. This is unbiased—we let the data tell us what’s distinctive about a cluster without assuming anything in advance.\nRun the de-cluster1 chunk to find markers for the largest cluster (cluster 1):\nmarkers_c1 &lt;- FindMarkers(sponge, ident.1 = 1, min.pct = 0.25)\nhead(markers_c1, 20)\nThe output shows genes ranked by statistical significance, with columns for log fold-change, detection rates, and adjusted p-values. Scroll through the top genes and look for patterns—are there gene families that keep coming up?\nNow run the fig-dotplot-c1 chunk to visualize these markers across all clusters:\ntop_genes &lt;- rownames(head(markers_c1, 15))\nDotPlot(sponge, features = top_genes) + RotatedAxis()\nIn the dot plot, dot size shows what fraction of cells in each cluster express the gene, and dot color shows average expression level. Look for genes that are strongly expressed in cluster 1 but absent or low in most other clusters.\n\n\n\nDot plot of top markers for cluster 1\n\n\nYou’ll see ribosomal genes (names starting with Rpl or Rps) dominating the top markers. This signature—high ribosomal gene expression indicating active protein synthesis—is characteristic of archaeocytes. Archaeocytes are the stem cell-like cells of sponges, and similar transcriptional profiles mark stem cells in many invertebrates.\n\n\n3.13.2 Approach 2: Candidate genes\nThe complementary strategy is to take genes you already know something about and look at where they’re expressed. This is the candidate gene approach.\nPiwi genes are highly conserved markers of stem cells and germline across animals. If archaeocytes are truly stem cell-like, they should express Piwi. Run the find-piwi chunk to search for it:\ngrep(\"iwi\", rownames(sponge), value = TRUE, ignore.case = TRUE)\nThis is a useful trick—when you don’t know the exact gene name in a dataset, grep() lets you search by partial match. You should see Piwil2 and Piwil1/3/4 in the results. Now run the fig-piwi chunk to see where Piwil2 is expressed:\np1 &lt;- VlnPlot(sponge, features = \"Piwil2\", pt.size = 0.1)\np2 &lt;- FeaturePlot(sponge, features = \"Piwil2\")\np1 + p2\nThe VlnPlot shows which clusters express Piwil2 most strongly. The FeaturePlot shows where those cells sit on the UMAP. If Piwil2 expression is concentrated in the same cluster that showed the ribosomal signature in the DE analysis, that’s convergent evidence: two independent approaches pointing to the same biological identity.\n\n\n\nPiwi expression — VlnPlot and FeaturePlot\n\n\nThis two-pronged strategy—unbiased differential expression to discover what’s distinctive, plus candidate genes to confirm identity—is a standard approach for annotating clusters in single-cell data.",

    "text": "4.1 Why Positron?\nIn Your First R Project, you used Positron’s core features—the console, environment pane, data viewer, plots pane, and terminal—to run a single-cell analysis. This chapter covers those features in more depth, plus keyboard shortcuts, customization, and workflows you’ll use daily.\nPositron is your home base. It’s where you write code, explore data, run analyses, and manage your project—all in one window. Built by Posit (the company behind RStudio) on top of VS Code, Positron combines the familiarity of RStudio with the power and extensibility of a modern code editor.\nIf you’re coming from RStudio, Positron will feel familiar: there’s an R console, a variable explorer, a data viewer, and a file browser. But Positron adds capabilities that matter for modern data science workflows:\nFirst-class support for both R and Python. Most lab projects use both languages. In RStudio, Python support is an afterthought. In Positron, both languages are treated equally—you can have R and Python sessions running side by side, each with its own console and environment viewer. In practice, we usually write one language per script (.qmd file), and Positron handles switching between them seamlessly.\nA superior Data Viewer. Click any dataframe in the Variables pane and it opens in a fast, interactive viewer. You can sort columns, filter rows, and search for values. For large datasets, it handles millions of rows smoothly. The Data Viewer is central to exploratory analysis—you’ll use it constantly.\nThe VS Code extension ecosystem. Positron inherits thousands of extensions: linters, formatters, Git tools, AI coding assistants. Unlike RStudio, which exists in its own world, Positron connects you to the broader developer tooling ecosystem.",

    "section": "4.2 The Interface",
    "text": "4.2 The Interface\nPositron’s default layout will feel familiar if you’ve used RStudio: the editor sits in the main area, with supporting panels around it.\n\n4.2.1 Layout Overview\nThe typical arrangement is:\n\nEditor (center): Where you write and edit .qmd files, R scripts, Python scripts, and other documents\nConsole (bottom): Your R or Python session—run code interactively here\nTerminal (bottom, tabbed with Console): For shell commands, git, conda, quarto\nVariables/Environment (right or bottom): Shows objects in your current session\nExplorer (left sidebar): Browse files, see document outline, and navigate your project\nSearch (left sidebar): Find text across your entire project\nSource Control (left sidebar): Stage and commit changes with Git\n\nYou can rearrange panels by dragging them, but the default layout works well for most workflows.\n\n\n4.2.2 The Console\nThe console shows your active R or Python session. When you run code from the editor (with Cmd+Enter or Ctrl+Enter), the output appears here. You can also type commands directly into the console for quick exploration.\nKey points:\n\nYou can have both an R console and a Python console open simultaneously\nEach console shows the active interpreter/environment in the prompt\nThe console is where you see errors, warnings, and printed output\n\n\n\n4.2.3 The Variables Pane\nShows all objects in your current R or Python session:\n\nDataframes display with row and column counts\nClick any dataframe to open it in the Data Viewer\nVectors, lists, and other objects show their type and size\n\nThis pane is essential for keeping track of what’s in memory during interactive development.\n\n\n4.2.4 The Data Viewer\nThe Data Viewer is one of Positron’s standout features. Click any dataframe in the Variables pane to open it in a spreadsheet-like view where you can:\n\nSort by clicking column headers\nFilter rows by typing conditions\nSearch for specific values\nNavigate large datasets smoothly (it handles millions of rows)\n\nDuring exploratory analysis, you’ll have the Data Viewer open constantly—checking data after each transformation, looking for unexpected values, verifying that joins worked correctly.\n[TODO: screenshot of Data Viewer with a dataframe open]\n\n\n4.2.5 The Terminal\nThe integrated terminal gives you a command line inside Positron. Use it for:\n\nRunning quarto render or quarto preview\nGit commands (though the Source Control panel is often easier)\nConda environment management\nAny shell command you’d normally run in Terminal.app or Command Prompt\n\nToggle the terminal with Cmd+** (macOS) or **Ctrl+ (Windows).\n\n\n4.2.6 The Explorer\nThe Explorer panel (left sidebar) is your file browser and navigation hub. Click the file icon at the top of the sidebar to open it. It has several sections:\nFiles: Shows all files and folders in your project. Click to open, right-click for options (rename, delete, new file).\nOutline: This is especially useful for longer scripts. The Outline section shows the structure of your current document:\n\nFor .qmd files: headings, code chunks, and sections\nFor R/Python files: functions and class definitions\n\nClick any item in the Outline to jump directly to that section. When you’re working on a longer analysis script, the Outline makes it easy to navigate between sections without scrolling.\n\n\n4.2.7 Search\nThe Search panel (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+F) finds text across your entire project. Useful for:\n\nFinding where a function is defined or used\nSearching for variable names across files\nLocating specific text in your project\n\nClick the .* button to enable regular expressions for more powerful pattern matching. While not as full-featured as dedicated text editors like BBEdit, regex search handles most common patterns.\n\n\n4.2.8 Source Control\nThe Source Control panel in the left sidebar handles Git operations visually:\n\nSee which files have changed (modified, added, deleted)\nStage files for commit by clicking the + icon\nWrite a commit message and commit with one click\nPush and pull from GitHub\n\nEven if you end up using Claude Code for most git operations, understanding the Source Control panel is foundational. It shows you what’s happening with your repository at a glance.",

These scripts:\n\nDon’t need number prefixes or BUILD_INFO.txt\nMust never be depended on by other scripts (one-way dependency — exploratory scripts can read from outs/, but nothing reads from exploratory outputs)\nCan be cleaned out periodically without breaking anything\nAre good candidates for promotion to numbered scripts when an analysis matures\n\n\n\n\n5.2.3 outs/ — Generated Outputs\nEvery script gets a corresponding output folder. Script 01_import_qc.qmd writes to outs/01_import_qc/:\nouts/\n├── 01_import_qc/\n│   ├── filtered_counts.rds\n│   ├── qc_report.html\n│   └── sample_summary.csv\n├── 02_normalize/\n│   └── normalized_counts.rds\n├── 03_differential/\n│   ├── limma_results.rds\n│   └── significant_hits.csv\n├── 04_volcano_plots/\n│   ├── volcano_3min.pdf\n│   ├── volcano_15min.pdf\n│   └── volcano_30min.pdf\n└── 05_heatmaps/\n    └── cluster_heatmap.pdf\nThis structure encodes provenance. When you see a file in outs/03_differential/, you know exactly which script created it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningClaude Code\n\n\n\nClaude Code can review your project layout and suggest improvements based on the lab’s conventions.\n\nHere’s my project folder structure: [paste output of ls -R]. I’m analyzing RNA-seq data from three conditions with time points. Does this organization make sense?\n\nClaude will compare your layout against the lab conventions, flag any issues (like outputs mixed with inputs), and suggest a cleaner structure.",

    "text": "6.1 Why Quarto?\nIn Your First R Project, you worked with a .qmd file—running code chunks interactively, viewing results in the plots pane, and rendering the document to HTML. This chapter explains Quarto’s syntax and features in depth so you can write your own analysis documents from scratch.\nQuarto is a scientific publishing system that lets you combine code, results, and narrative text in a single document. You write analysis scripts as .qmd files—plain text with embedded R or Python code—and Quarto renders them into polished HTML reports with your outputs automatically included.\nIn the Musser Lab, Quarto documents are the standard format for data analysis because they solve a fundamental problem: keeping your code, your results, and your explanation of those results in sync. When you render a .qmd file, Quarto executes the code fresh and weaves the outputs into the document, so the report always reflects the actual analysis.",

    "text": "6.1.1 Compared to Plain R Scripts\nA plain .R script is just code. It can produce outputs, but there’s no built-in way to document what the code does, why you made certain choices, or what the results mean. When you share a script, collaborators see the code but not your interpretation.\nWith Quarto:\n\nCode and narrative live together — explain what you’re doing as you do it\nResults are embedded — figures and tables appear in the document\nOutput is shareable — render to HTML that anyone can open in a browser\n\n\n\n6.1.2 Compared to R Markdown\nIf you’ve used R Markdown (.Rmd), Quarto will feel familiar. The core idea—mixing code, results, and narrative—is the same. Quarto is R Markdown’s successor, developed by Posit (the company behind RStudio) as a unified system that works equally well with R, Python, Julia, and other languages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR Markdown\nQuarto\n\n\n\n\nFile extension\n.Rmd\n.qmd\n\n\nLanguage support\nR-centric (Python possible but awkward)\nMulti-language by design\n\n\nChunk options\n{r, echo=FALSE}\n#| echo: false (YAML-style)\n\n\nOutput formats\nDocuments, some websites\nDocuments, websites, books, slides, dashboards\n\n\n\nYou don’t need to memorize the differences. If you know R Markdown, Quarto works similarly. If you’re new to both, just learn Quarto—it’s the modern standard.\n\n\n6.1.3 What Else Can Quarto Do?\nWhile we primarily use Quarto for analysis scripts, it’s a general-purpose publishing system. This book was built with Quarto. You can also create:\n\nWebsites — project documentation, lab websites\nPresentations — slides rendered from code (RevealJS format)\nDashboards — interactive displays of data\n\nSee the Quarto documentation if you want to explore these formats.",

    "section": "6.2 The Interactive Development Workflow",
    "text": "6.2 The Interactive Development Workflow\nBefore diving into syntax, understand how you’ll actually work with Quarto documents. The workflow has two modes:\n\n6.2.1 Interactive Development\nMost of your time is spent running code interactively—executing chunks one at a time, inspecting results, and iterating. This is exploratory work:\n\nWrite a chunk of code in your .qmd file\nRun it with Cmd+Enter (macOS) or Ctrl+Enter (Windows)\nInspect the output in the Console, Variables pane, or Data Viewer\nIterate — modify the code, run again, check results\nMove on to the next chunk when satisfied\n\nDuring interactive development, you’re using Positron like an enhanced REPL. The .qmd file is your scratch pad. Objects you create persist in your R or Python session, so you can build on previous chunks.\n[TODO: screenshot of Positron with .qmd open, console showing output, Data Viewer with dataframe]\n\n\n6.2.2 Rendering\nWhen the analysis is complete—or when you want to share it—you render the document:\nquarto render my_analysis.qmd\nRendering executes every code chunk in a fresh session (no leftover objects from interactive work) and produces a standalone HTML file. This catches errors you might miss interactively, like relying on an object you created manually but forgot to include in the script.\nThe key insight: Interactive mode is for development. Rendering is for validation and sharing. Always render before committing or sending a report to someone.\n\n\n6.2.3 A Typical Session\nHere’s what a working session looks like:\n\nOpen your project in Positron\nOpen or create a .qmd file\nWrite the setup chunk (libraries, paths)\nRun it interactively to confirm packages load\nWrite a data-loading chunk, run it, inspect the data in Data Viewer\nWrite analysis chunks one at a time, running and checking each\nWhen complete, render the full document\nFix any errors that appear during render (usually missing objects or packages)\nCommit the .qmd file (and optionally the rendered HTML)\n\nThis interactive-then-render workflow is why Quarto documents are more reliable than scripts you only ever run interactively.",

The code runs fine interactively in the console. What’s going wrong?\n\nClaude will trace the error to its cause—typically a missing object that existed in your interactive session but isn’t created in the script, or a path that resolves differently during rendering.\n\n\n\n6.14.1 “Object not found” During Render\nCode that works interactively may fail during render if you rely on objects not created in the script.\nCause: You created an object manually in the console, then used it in a chunk without creating it in the script.\nFix: Ensure all objects are created within the .qmd. Render frequently to catch this early.\n\n\n6.14.2 Figures Not Appearing\nIf a plot doesn’t show up in the rendered output:\np &lt;- ggplot(data, aes(x, y)) + geom_point()\nprint(p)  # Required inside loops or complex chunks\nThe explicit print() is needed when the plot is the result of an assignment or is inside a loop/function.\n\n\n6.14.3 Package Messages Cluttering Output\nSet message: false and warning: false in the execute: block:\nexecute:\n  message: false\n  warning: false\nOr per-chunk for specific chunks.\n\n\n6.14.4 Output File Is Huge\nIf your HTML is very large:\n\nEmbedded images: Use self-contained: false to keep images in a separate _files folder\nHigh resolution: Add fig-dpi: 150 to reduce figure resolution\nSVG format: Use fig-format: png instead of SVG for complex plots\n\n\n\n6.14.5 Chunk Takes Forever\nFor long-running chunks during development, consider:\n#| cache: true\nThis caches the chunk’s results. Subsequent renders skip execution if the code hasn’t changed. Use sparingly—caching can cause subtle bugs if dependencies change.",

This chapter explains what those commands actually do under the hood, and covers rig for managing R versions alongside renv for packages.\nManaging R effectively requires two things: controlling which version of R you’re running, and controlling which packages are installed for each project. We use rig for the former and renv for the latter. Together, they give you the same isolation and reproducibility that conda provides for Python.\nWithout version management:\nWith rig + renv:",

    "text": "7.2 rig: Managing R Versions\nrig (R Installation Manager) lets you install, switch between, and manage multiple R versions from the command line. The Installation chapter covers how to install rig itself; this section covers day-to-day usage.\n\n7.2.1 Why Multiple R Versions?\nYou might need multiple R versions when:\n\nCollaborating: A collaborator’s project uses R 4.3, but your default is R 4.4\nBioconductor compatibility: Bioconductor versions are tied to specific R versions (see Bioconductor section below)\nLegacy projects: An older analysis needs to run exactly as it did originally\nTesting: You want to verify code works across R versions before sharing\n\n\n\n7.2.2 Essential rig Commands\n# List installed R versions\nrig list\n\n# Install the latest stable R\nrig add release\n\n# Install a specific version\nrig add 4.3\n\n# Set the system default\nrig default 4.4\n\n# See which version is default\nrig default\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoterig add vs. CRAN installers\n\n\n\nWhen you run rig add, it downloads and installs R without removing previous versions. This is different from downloading R directly from CRAN, which typically overwrites your existing installation.\n\n\n\n\n7.2.3 Setting R Version Per Project\nFor reproducibility, you can lock a specific R version to a project so that Positron always uses it, regardless of your system default. Add this to .vscode/settings.json in your project:\n\nmacOS (Apple Silicon)macOS (Intel)Windows\n\n\n{\n  \"r.rpath.mac\": \"/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.4-arm64/Resources/bin/R\"\n}\n\n\n{\n  \"r.rpath.mac\": \"/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.4-x86_64/Resources/bin/R\"\n}\n\n\n{\n  \"r.rpath.windows\": \"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\R\\\\R-4.4.0\\\\bin\\\\R.exe\"\n}\n\n\n\nYou can also set this interactively: open the Command Palette in Positron (Cmd+Shift+P / Ctrl+Shift+P) and select R: Select R Binary. See the Positron chapter for more details.",

Instead of all projects sharing your user library, each project gets its own renv/library/ folder with exactly the packages it needs.\n\n7.3.1 The Workflow\nThe renv workflow has four steps:\n\nInitialize renv in your project (renv::init())\nInstall packages as you work (install.packages() or renv::install())\nSnapshot to record what you installed (renv::snapshot())\nRestore on another machine or after cloning (renv::restore())\n\n\n\n7.3.2 Initialize renv\nIn a new or existing R project:\n# Install renv if needed (only once per R installation)\ninstall.packages(\"renv\")\n\n# Initialize renv for this project\nrenv::init()\nThis creates:\n\n\n\nFile/Folder\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nrenv/\nLocal package library (packages installed here)\n\n\nrenv.lock\nLockfile recording exact package versions\n\n\n.Rprofile\nActivates renv automatically when R starts\n\n\nrenv/activate.R\nThe activation script\n\n\n\nWhen you open the project in Positron and start R, you’ll see:\n- Project '/path/to/project' loaded. [renv 1.0.0]\nThis confirms renv is active.\n\n\n7.3.3 Installing Packages\nWith renv active, install packages as usual:\n# Install from CRAN\ninstall.packages(\"ggplot2\")\n\n# Install multiple packages\ninstall.packages(c(\"dplyr\", \"tidyr\", \"readr\"))\nFor more control, use renv::install():\n# Install from GitHub\nrenv::install(\"tidyverse/ggplot2\")\n\n# Install a specific version\nrenv::install(\"ggplot2@3.4.0\")\n\n# Install from Bioconductor (after setting up BiocManager)\nrenv::install(\"bioc::DESeq2\")\n\n\n7.3.4 Snapshot\nAfter installing or updating packages, save the current state:\nrenv::snapshot()\nThis updates renv.lock with the exact versions of all packages in your project library. Always snapshot after installing packages, and commit the updated renv.lock to Git.\n\n\n7.3.5 Restore\nWhen you clone a project or set it up on a new machine:\nrenv::restore()\nThis reads renv.lock and installs every package at the exact version recorded. This is how collaborators reproduce your environment.\n\n\n7.3.6 Status\nCheck whether your library matches the lockfile:\nrenv::status()\nThis tells you if packages are:\n\nMissing from the library (need renv::restore())\nInstalled but not in the lockfile (need renv::snapshot())\nDifferent versions than the lockfile\n\nRun renv::status() before committing to ensure your lockfile is current.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningClaude Code\n\n\n\nClaude Code can interpret renv status messages and tell you whether to restore() or snapshot().\n\nI’m getting Project 'my-project' is out-of-sync when I start R. Here’s the output of renv::status(): [paste output]. Should I restore or snapshot?\n\nClaude will read the status output, explain which packages are out of sync and why, and recommend the right command.",

    "section": "7.4 Core R Packages",
    "text": "7.4 Core R Packages\n\n7.4.1 The tidyverse\nThe tidyverse is a collection of R packages that share a common design philosophy centered on “tidy data”—rectangular data where each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each value is a cell. This simple principle, combined with a consistent and expressive syntax, has made the tidyverse the standard toolkit for data analysis in R.\nWhat makes the tidyverse transformative is that it provides a unified grammar for the entire data analysis pipeline: importing data, reshaping it, transforming it, visualizing it, and communicating results. The packages are designed to work together seamlessly, with consistent naming conventions and compatible data structures. Code written in tidyverse style tends to be readable and self-documenting—you can often understand what a pipeline does just by reading it.\nThe tidyverse occupies the same role in R that pandas does in Python: both represent the modern, dataframe-centric approach to data manipulation. While they developed somewhat independently (pandas emerged around 2008, dplyr in 2014), they share the philosophy that most data analysis tasks involve filtering rows, selecting columns, creating new variables, grouping, and summarizing. If you learn one well, the concepts transfer to the other.\nThe core tidyverse packages are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackage\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\ndplyr\nData manipulation: filter rows, select columns, create new variables, summarize, join tables\n\n\nggplot2\nVisualization using the grammar of graphics\n\n\ntidyr\nReshape data: pivot between wide and long formats\n\n\nreadr\nFast, consistent data import (read_csv, read_tsv, etc.)\n\n\npurrr\nFunctional programming: apply functions across lists and vectors\n\n\nstringr\nString manipulation with consistent syntax\n\n\n\nLoading the tidyverse meta-package loads all of these at once:\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipLearning the tidyverse\n\n\n\nThis guide assumes basic familiarity with tidyverse syntax. If you’re new to R or transitioning from base R, work through R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund. It’s the definitive resource for learning modern R workflows.\n\n\n\n\n7.4.2 Other Essential Packages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackage\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nhere\nBuild file paths relative to the project root—essential for reproducible scripts\n\n\nknitr\nRequired for rendering Quarto documents with R code",

    "section": "7.5 Bioconductor",
    "text": "7.5 Bioconductor\nBioconductor is a specialized repository of R packages for bioinformatics and computational biology. It’s separate from CRAN and has its own installation system, release schedule, and quality standards. If you’re doing genomics, transcriptomics, or single-cell analysis in R, you’ll use Bioconductor packages extensively.\n\n7.5.1 What Makes Bioconductor Different\nCurated and reviewed: Packages undergo technical review before acceptance and must meet documentation and testing standards.\nCoordinated releases: All Bioconductor packages are released together twice per year, tested against each other for compatibility.\nSpecialized data structures: Bioconductor defines standard classes for genomic data (SummarizedExperiment, SingleCellExperiment, etc.) that packages use consistently.\nTied to R versions: Each Bioconductor release requires a specific R version. This is important for reproducibility.\n\n\n7.5.2 Installing Bioconductor Packages\nBioconductor packages are installed via BiocManager, not install.packages():\n# First, install BiocManager (only once)\ninstall.packages(\"BiocManager\")\n\n# Then install Bioconductor packages\nBiocManager::install(\"DESeq2\")\nBiocManager::install(c(\"limma\", \"edgeR\", \"tximport\"))\n\n# Don't forget to snapshot\nrenv::snapshot()\nrenv automatically detects Bioconductor packages and records them correctly in the lockfile.\n\n\n7.5.3 Bioconductor Version Synchronization\nBioconductor versions are tied to R versions:\n\n\n\nBioconductor\nR Version\nRelease Date\n\n\n\n\n3.18\nR 4.3.x\nOct 2023\n\n\n3.19\nR 4.4.x\nMay 2024\n\n\n3.20\nR 4.4.x\nOct 2024\n\n\n3.21\nR 4.5.x\nMay 2025\n\n\n\nWhy this matters: If you developed an analysis with R 4.3 and Bioconductor 3.18, a collaborator with R 4.4 will get Bioconductor 3.19 or 3.20—potentially with different package behaviors. For critical analyses, pin the R version in your project settings (see Setting R Version Per Project above).\nCheck your current Bioconductor version:\nBiocManager::version()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBioconductor and renv\n\n\n\nWhen you use renv, the Bioconductor version is recorded in renv.lock along with package versions. Running renv::restore() on a new machine will install packages from the same Bioconductor release, helping ensure reproducibility.\n\n\n\n\n7.5.4 RNA-seq Analysis Packages\nThese packages form the core toolkit for bulk RNA-seq differential expression analysis:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackage\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nDESeq2\nDifferential expression using negative binomial generalized linear models. The most widely used method.\n\n\nlimma\nLinear models for differential expression. Includes voom for RNA-seq count data. Fast and flexible.\n\n\nedgeR\nDifferential expression using empirical Bayes estimation. Similar approach to DESeq2.\n\n\ntximport\nImport transcript-level quantifications from Salmon, kallisto, or RSEM into gene-level counts.\n\n\ntximeta\nLike tximport but automatically attaches metadata about the reference transcriptome.\n\n\ngoseq\nGene Ontology enrichment analysis that accounts for gene length bias in RNA-seq data.\n\n\n\nA typical RNA-seq analysis workflow uses tximport or tximeta to import quantifications, then DESeq2 (or limma/edgeR) for differential expression, then goseq for pathway analysis.\n\n\n7.5.5 Single-Cell Analysis Packages\nSingle-cell RNA-seq requires specialized methods. These are the main packages:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackage\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nSeurat\nComprehensive toolkit for single-cell analysis: QC, normalization, clustering, visualization, integration across datasets. The most popular choice.\n\n\nSingleCellExperiment\nBioconductor’s standard data structure for single-cell data. Many packages use this format.\n\n\nscran\nNormalization (pooling-based), feature selection, and clustering methods from the Bioconductor ecosystem.\n\n\nscater\nQuality control, visualization, and preprocessing. Works with SingleCellExperiment objects.\n\n\nMonocle3\nTrajectory analysis and pseudotime inference—modeling how cells transition between states.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteSeurat vs. Bioconductor ecosystem\n\n\n\nSeurat is the most popular single-cell package but isn’t part of Bioconductor—it’s on CRAN (and GitHub). The Bioconductor single-cell packages (SingleCellExperiment, scran, scater) form an alternative ecosystem. Many workflows use both: Seurat for analysis and visualization, with conversion to SingleCellExperiment when needed for specific Bioconductor tools.",

Subsequent operations use a global cache, so packages shared across projects only download once.\n\n\n7.10.7 Starting Fresh\nIf things are really broken:\n# Deactivate renv\nrenv::deactivate()\n\n# Remove renv files (in terminal)\n# rm -rf renv renv.lock .Rprofile\n\n# Reinitialize\nrenv::init()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThis removes your lockfile.

    "text": "8.2 Basic Commands\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteWindows Users: Initialize Your Shell First\n\n\n\nAfter installing Miniforge/conda on Windows, you must initialize your shell before conda activate will work. Open your terminal and run:\nPowerShell:\nconda init powershell\nCommand Prompt:\nconda init cmd.exe\nThen close and reopen your terminal. You only need to do this once.\n\n\n\n8.2.1 Create an Environment\nYou only need to create the environment once. New environments can be initiated with just a python installation, or include additional packages from the start. The option -n project_name specifies the name of the environment, and is followed by an initial list of packages to install:\n# Create with just Python\nconda create -n my-project python=3.11\n\n# Create with core data science packages (recommended)\nconda create -n my-project python=3.11 numpy pandas matplotlib ipykernel\n\n\n8.2.2 Core Data Science Packages\nWhen setting up a new project environment, common data science packages you might include are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackage\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nnumpy\nNumerical computing with arrays and matrices\n\n\npandas\nData manipulation and analysis (dataframes)\n\n\nmatplotlib\nPlotting and visualization\n\n\nipykernel\nRequired for Quarto to execute Python .qmd files\n\n\nseaborn\nStatistical data visualization (built on matplotlib)\n\n\nsession-info\nPython session info for reproducibility (install via pip)\n\n\n\nA typical environment creation command:\nconda create -n my-project python=3.11 numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn ipykernel -y\npip install session-info\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantAlways Include ipykernel\n\n\n\nEvery data science environment must include ipykernel. Without it, Quarto cannot execute Python .qmd files — you’ll get a kernel error when rendering. Make it a habit to include it in every conda create command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteWhat about Jupyter?\n\n\n\nYou don’t need jupyter or jupyterlab for our workflow—Quarto handles document rendering directly. Only install them if you receive .ipynb notebook files from collaborators and want to open them in the traditional notebook interface.\n\n\n\n\n8.2.3 Activate/Deactivate\n# Activate (start using the environment)\nconda activate my-project\n\n# Deactivate (return to base)\nconda deactivate\nWhen activated, your prompt shows the environment name:\n\nmacOS / LinuxWindows\n\n\n(my-project) $\n\n\n(my-project) C:\\Users\\yourname&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.4 Install Packages\n# Install a package\nconda install pandas\n\n# Install specific version\nconda install pandas=2.0\n\n# Install multiple packages\nconda install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn\n\n\n8.2.5 List Environments\n# See all environments\nconda env list\n\n# See packages in current environment\nconda list\n\n\n8.2.6 Remove Environment\nconda env remove -n my-project",

    "text": "8.6 Channels\nChannels are package repositories where conda looks for packages. Understanding channels matters because the same package can exist in multiple channels with different versions or builds.\n\n8.6.1 Main Channels\n\nconda-forge: Community-maintained, comprehensive, well-tested. This is the primary channel for most scientific packages.\nbioconda: Bioinformatics tools (samtools, bedtools, bwa, etc.). Essential for genomics work.\ndefaults: Anaconda’s default channel. We generally avoid this in favor of conda-forge.\n\n\n\n8.6.2 Channel Priority\nWhen a package exists in multiple channels, conda uses channel priority to decide which version to install. We recommend strict priority with conda-forge first:\n# Configure strict channel priority (one-time setup)\nconda config --set channel_priority strict\nThis ensures conda-forge packages are always preferred, avoiding subtle version mismatches.\n\n\n8.6.3 Using Bioconda\nFor bioinformatics tools, add bioconda to your channels. The recommended order is:\n# Add channels in priority order (highest priority last)\nconda config --add channels defaults\nconda config --add channels bioconda\nconda config --add channels conda-forge\nThen install bioinformatics tools normally:\nconda install samtools bedtools\n\n\n8.6.4 Specifying Channels in environment.yml\nFor reproducibility, specify channels in your environment file:\nname: genomics-project\nchannels:\n  - conda-forge\n  - bioconda\n  - defaults\ndependencies:\n  - python=3.11\n  - pandas\n  - samtools\n  - bedtools\nThe order matters—channels listed first have higher priority.",

Set libmamba as your default:\nconda config --set solver libmamba\nThen try again. If you’ve already configured libmamba and it’s still slow, you may have conflicting package requirements.\n\n\n8.8.2 Dependency Conflicts\nSymptoms: Conda reports “conflict” or can’t find a solution when installing a package.\nSolutions:\n\nCheck channel mixing: Packages from different channels may conflict. Use strict channel priority with conda-forge first.\nLoosen version constraints: If you’re requesting specific versions, try letting conda choose:\n# Instead of\nconda install pandas=1.5 numpy=1.24\n# Try\nconda install pandas numpy\nStart fresh: Sometimes it’s easier to recreate the environment:\nconda deactivate\nconda env remove -n my-project\nconda create -n my-project python=3.11 numpy pandas matplotlib ipykernel\n# Add other packages one at a time\nCheck bioconda compatibility: Some bioinformatics packages have strict dependencies. Check the package’s documentation for known issues.\n\n\n\n8.8.3 Package not found\n\nCheck spelling\nEnsure you have the right channels configured (conda-forge, bioconda)\nSearch for the package: conda search package-name\nFall back to pip if it’s not in conda\n\n\n\n8.8.4 macOS/Linux: “conda: command not found”\nYour shell isn’t configured for conda. Run:\nsource ~/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh\n# or if using Miniforge:\nsource ~/miniforge3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh\nTo make this permanent, add that line to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc file.\n\n\n8.8.5 Environment corrupted\nRemove and recreate:\nconda deactivate\nconda env remove -n my-project\nconda env create -f environment.yml\n\n\n8.8.6 Windows: “conda activate” does nothing or errors\nThis usually means conda isn’t initialized for your shell. Run:\n# For PowerShell\nconda init powershell\n\n# For Command Prompt\nconda init cmd.exe\nThen restart your terminal. If you’re using VS Code or Positron’s integrated terminal, close and reopen the entire application.\n\n\n8.8.7 Windows: “conda is not recognized”\nThe Miniforge installer may not have added conda to your PATH. Either:\n\nUse the “Miniforge Prompt” from the Start menu (this has conda pre-configured)\nOr add Miniforge to your PATH manually:\n\nSearch “Environment Variables” in Windows Settings\nAdd C:\\Users\\YourName\\miniforge3\\Scripts to your PATH",

Your commit history becomes a record of how your analysis evolved: what you tried, what you changed, and why.\nThis practice pays off in several ways:\n\nA record of your work: Every commit documents what you did and when, which helps with scientific integrity and your own memory\nSafety net: Experiment freely knowing you can always go back if something breaks\nBackup: Combined with GitHub, your work survives laptop failures and accidental deletions\nReproducibility: Collaborators (and future you) can trace exactly what code produced which results\n\nYou don’t need to master every Git feature—the basics go a long way. The next sections cover what you need for daily work.",

    "text": "Key Concepts\nBefore using Git, understand these core ideas:\n\nRepository (repo)\n\nA project folder that Git is tracking. Contains a hidden .git folder that stores the entire history.\n\nCommit\n\nA snapshot of your project at a moment in time. Each commit has a unique ID (like a1b2c3d), a message describing what changed, and a pointer to the previous commit. Commits form a chain—your project’s history.\n\nStaging area\n\nA holding area for changes you want to include in your next commit. You “stage” files first, then “commit” them. This two-step process lets you commit only some of your changes.\n\nBranch\n\nA parallel version of your project. The default branch is called main. You can create other branches to experiment without affecting main, then merge them back when ready.\n\nRemote\n\nA copy of your repository on another server—typically GitHub. Your local repo and the remote stay in sync through pushing (uploading your commits) and pulling (downloading others’ commits).",

    "section": "The Daily Workflow in Positron",
    "text": "The Daily Workflow in Positron\nMost of your Git usage follows this pattern: edit files, stage changes, commit with a message, and push to GitHub. Positron’s Source Control panel makes this straightforward without needing to use the command line.\n\nOpening Source Control\nClick the branch icon in the left sidebar, or use Cmd+Shift+G (macOS) / Ctrl+Shift+G (Windows). You’ll see:\n\nChanges: Files you’ve modified since the last commit\nStaged Changes: Files ready to be committed\n\n\n\nThe Basic Cycle\n1. Make changes to your files\nWork normally—edit scripts, add new files, delete things you don’t need. Git tracks everything automatically.\n2. Review what changed\nOpen the Source Control panel. You’ll see a list of changed files under “Changes.” Click any file to see a diff view showing exactly what lines were added (green) or removed (red).\n3. Stage files for commit\nClick the + icon next to each file you want to include in your commit. The file moves from “Changes” to “Staged Changes.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipBe intentional about staging\n\n\n\nYou don’t have to stage everything at once. If you made unrelated changes to several files, you can commit them separately with different messages. This keeps your history cleaner and easier to understand.\n\n\n4. Write a commit message and commit\nType a message in the text box at the top of the Source Control panel. Then click the checkmark (✓) to commit.\n5. Push to GitHub\nClick the three-dot menu (⋯) and select Push, or click the sync icon in the status bar. Until you push, your commits exist only on your computer.\n6. Pull before starting work\nIf you’re collaborating or working from multiple computers, always pull before you start making changes. Click the three-dot menu → Pull to download any new commits from GitHub.\n\n\nWhat the Icons Mean\nIn the Source Control panel, you’ll see letters next to changed files:\n\nM (Modified): An existing file was changed\nU (Untracked): A new file Git hasn’t seen before\nD (Deleted): A file was removed\nA (Added): A new file that’s been staged",

    "section": "Beyond the Basics",
    "text": "Beyond the Basics\nThe workflow above covers 90% of what you’ll do with Git. But Git has powerful features for more complex situations. Here’s what they are and when you might need them—you don’t need to learn these now, but it helps to know they exist.\n\nBranches\nA branch is a parallel version of your project. The main use case: you want to try something experimental without risking your working code. You create a branch, make changes there, and if it works, you merge it back into main. If it doesn’t, you delete the branch and main is untouched.\nPositron’s Source Control panel shows your current branch in the status bar and lets you create and switch branches through the branch menu. For solo analysis work, you often don’t need branches—committing directly to main is fine. Branches become more useful when collaborating or when you want to experiment with major changes.\n\n\nMerge Conflicts\nConflicts happen when two people change the same lines in a file, or when you have changes on two different computers that overlap. Git can’t automatically decide which version to keep, so it asks you to resolve it manually.\nWhen this happens, the conflicting file will show both versions with special markers. You edit the file to keep the version you want (or combine them), then commit the resolution. Positron highlights conflicts and provides tools to help resolve them.\nConflicts are less common than you might fear, especially on solo projects. Pull before you start working, and you’ll rarely encounter them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningClaude Code\n\n\n\nClaude Code can explain confusing Git messages and suggest safe next steps.\n\nGit is showing me this and I’m not sure what to do: Your branch and 'origin/main' have diverged, and have 2 and 3 different commits each, respectively. What does this mean and how do I fix it?\n\nClaude will explain the situation in plain language (your local and remote branches have different changes) and walk you through resolving it safely, typically with git pull --rebase or a merge.\n\n\n\n\nUndoing Mistakes\nGit provides ways to undo changes at every stage:\n\nBefore staging: Discard changes to a file, reverting to the last committed version\nAfter staging but before committing: Unstage files while keeping your changes\nAfter committing: Undo the last commit (keeping the changes) or amend it with corrections\nAfter pushing: This is trickier—changes are on the server. Usually you make a new commit that reverses the problematic one.\n\nThe Source Control panel provides options for discarding and unstaging changes. More complex undo operations (like reverting commits) are available through the Command Palette or by asking for help.\n\n\nPull Requests\nPull requests (PRs) are GitHub’s way of proposing changes for review before merging them. Instead of committing directly to main, you create a branch, push it to GitHub, and open a PR. Others can review the changes and discuss before merging.\nFor solo work, PRs are optional. They’re most valuable when you want someone else to review your code before it becomes part of the main project, or when you want a clear record of when and why a set of changes was merged.",
