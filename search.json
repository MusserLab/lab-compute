Most lab projects use both R and Python: R is often best for statistical analysis, plotting, and many important legacy packages used for RNA sequencing and proteomic analysis (e.g. Seurat, DESeq2, and limma); Python is often best for automating analysis pipelines (including in bash), manipulating files, working with sequences and strings, and a growing number of RNAseq data analysis libraries (e.g. Scanpy, metacell) and plotting libraries (e.g. Matplotlib). The goal of this guide is to help you set up a standard workflow for creating computational projects that are well-managed, documented, collaborative, and reproducible.\nThe lab’s standard toolchain is:",

Use this while developing—you can inspect objects, test code, and debug interactively. The results appear in the console and plots pane.\nRendering (quarto render): Runs the entire document in a fresh R session and produces an HTML (or PDF/Word) output. Use this when you want a polished, shareable report. Because rendering starts fresh, it catches errors that might not appear interactively (like relying on objects you created earlier but forgot to include in the script).\nDuring development, work interactively. When you’re ready to share or commit, render the full document to ensure it runs cleanly from start to finish.",

    "text": "4.1 Why Positron?\nPositron is your home base. It’s where you write code, explore data, run analyses, and manage your project—all in one window. Built by Posit (the company behind RStudio) on top of VS Code, Positron combines the familiarity of RStudio with the power and extensibility of a modern code editor.\nIf you’re coming from RStudio, Positron will feel familiar: there’s an R console, a variable explorer, a data viewer, and a file browser. But Positron adds capabilities that matter for modern data science workflows:\nFirst-class support for both R and Python. Most lab projects use both languages. In RStudio, Python support is an afterthought. In Positron, both languages are treated equally—you can have R and Python sessions running side by side, each with its own console and environment viewer. In practice, we usually write one language per script (.qmd file), and Positron handles switching between them seamlessly.\nA superior Data Viewer. Click any dataframe in the Variables pane and it opens in a fast, interactive viewer. You can sort columns, filter rows, and search for values. For large datasets, it handles millions of rows smoothly. The Data Viewer is central to exploratory analysis—you’ll use it constantly.\nThe VS Code extension ecosystem. Positron inherits thousands of extensions: linters, formatters, Git tools, AI coding assistants. Unlike RStudio, which exists in its own world, Positron connects you to the broader developer tooling ecosystem.\nIf you’ve used RStudio before, see the RStudio → Positron translation table on the Welcome page for a quick mapping of concepts.\n[TODO: screenshot of Positron interface with labeled panes]",

    "section": "4.2 The Interface",
    "text": "4.2 The Interface\nPositron’s default layout will feel familiar if you’ve used RStudio: the editor sits in the main area, with supporting panels around it.\n\n4.2.1 Layout Overview\nThe typical arrangement is:\n\nEditor (center): Where you write and edit .qmd files, R scripts, Python scripts, and other documents\nConsole (bottom): Your R or Python session—run code interactively here\nTerminal (bottom, tabbed with Console): For shell commands, git, conda, quarto\nVariables/Environment (right or bottom): Shows objects in your current session\nExplorer (left sidebar): Browse files, see document outline, and navigate your project\nSearch (left sidebar): Find text across your entire project\nSource Control (left sidebar): Stage and commit changes with Git\n\nYou can rearrange panels by dragging them, but the default layout works well for most workflows.\n\n\n4.2.2 The Console\nThe console shows your active R or Python session. When you run code from the editor (with Cmd+Enter or Ctrl+Enter), the output appears here. You can also type commands directly into the console for quick exploration.\nKey points:\n\nYou can have both an R console and a Python console open simultaneously\nEach console shows the active interpreter/environment in the prompt\nThe console is where you see errors, warnings, and printed output\n\n\n\n4.2.3 The Variables Pane\nShows all objects in your current R or Python session:\n\nDataframes display with row and column counts\nClick any dataframe to open it in the Data Viewer\nVectors, lists, and other objects show their type and size\n\nThis pane is essential for keeping track of what’s in memory during interactive development.\n\n\n4.2.4 The Data Viewer\nThe Data Viewer is one of Positron’s standout features. Click any dataframe in the Variables pane to open it in a spreadsheet-like view where you can:\n\nSort by clicking column headers\nFilter rows by typing conditions\nSearch for specific values\nNavigate large datasets smoothly (it handles millions of rows)\n\nDuring exploratory analysis, you’ll have the Data Viewer open constantly—checking data after each transformation, looking for unexpected values, verifying that joins worked correctly.\n[TODO: screenshot of Data Viewer with a dataframe open]\n\n\n4.2.5 The Terminal\nThe integrated terminal gives you a command line inside Positron. Use it for:\n\nRunning quarto render or quarto preview\nGit commands (though the Source Control panel is often easier)\nConda environment management\nAny shell command you’d normally run in Terminal.app or Command Prompt\n\nToggle the terminal with Cmd+** (macOS) or **Ctrl+ (Windows).\n\n\n4.2.6 The Explorer\nThe Explorer panel (left sidebar) is your file browser and navigation hub. Click the file icon at the top of the sidebar to open it. It has several sections:\nFiles: Shows all files and folders in your project. Click to open, right-click for options (rename, delete, new file).\nOutline: This is especially useful for longer scripts. The Outline section shows the structure of your current document:\n\nFor .qmd files: headings, code chunks, and sections\nFor R/Python files: functions and class definitions\n\nClick any item in the Outline to jump directly to that section. When you’re working on a longer analysis script, the Outline makes it easy to navigate between sections without scrolling.\n\n\n4.2.7 Search\nThe Search panel (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+F) finds text across your entire project. Useful for:\n\nFinding where a function is defined or used\nSearching for variable names across files\nLocating specific text in your project\n\nClick the .* button to enable regular expressions for more powerful pattern matching. While not as full-featured as dedicated text editors like BBEdit, regex search handles most common patterns.\n\n\n4.2.8 Source Control\nThe Source Control panel in the left sidebar handles Git operations visually:\n\nSee which files have changed (modified, added, deleted)\nStage files for commit by clicking the + icon\nWrite a commit message and commit with one click\nPush and pull from GitHub\n\nEven if you end up using Claude Code for most git operations, understanding the Source Control panel is foundational. It shows you what’s happening with your repository at a glance.",

This is the primary channel for most scientific packages.\nbioconda: Bioinformatics tools (samtools, bedtools, bwa, etc.). Essential for genomics work.\ndefaults: Anaconda’s default channel. We generally avoid this in favor of conda-forge.\n\n\n\n5.6.2 Channel Priority\nWhen a package exists in multiple channels, conda uses channel priority to decide which version to install.

Use strict channel priority with conda-forge first.\nLoosen version constraints: If you’re requesting specific versions, try letting conda choose:\n# Instead of\nconda install pandas=1.5 numpy=1.24\n# Try\nconda install pandas numpy\nStart fresh: Sometimes it’s easier to recreate the environment:\nconda deactivate\nconda env remove -n my-project\nconda create -n my-project python=3.11 numpy pandas matplotlib ipykernel\n# Add other packages one at a time\nCheck bioconda compatibility: Some bioinformatics packages have strict dependencies. Check the package’s documentation for known issues.\n\n\n\n5.8.3 Package not found\n\nCheck spelling\nEnsure you have the right channels configured (conda-forge, bioconda)\nSearch for the package: conda search package-name\nFall back to pip if it’s not in conda\n\n\n\n5.8.4 macOS/Linux: “conda: command not found”\nYour shell isn’t configured for conda. Run:\nsource ~/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh\n# or if using Miniforge:\nsource ~/miniforge3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh\nTo make this permanent, add that line to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc file.\n\n\n5.8.5 Environment corrupted\nRemove and recreate:\nconda deactivate\nconda env remove -n my-project\nconda env create -f environment.yml\n\n\n5.8.6 Windows: “conda activate” does nothing or errors\nThis usually means conda isn’t initialized for your shell.

The Installation chapter covers how to install rig itself; this section covers day-to-day usage.\n\n6.2.1 Why Multiple R Versions?\nYou might need multiple R versions when:\n\nCollaborating: A collaborator’s project uses R 4.3, but your default is R 4.4\nBioconductor compatibility: Bioconductor versions are tied to specific R versions (see Bioconductor section below)\nLegacy projects: An older analysis needs to run exactly as it did originally\nTesting: You want to verify code works across R versions before sharing\n\n\n\n6.2.2 Essential rig Commands\n# List installed R versions\nrig list\n\n# Install the latest stable R\nrig add release\n\n# Install a specific version\nrig add 4.3\n\n# Set the system default\nrig default 4.4\n\n# See which version is default\nrig default\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoterig add vs. CRAN installers\n\n\n\nWhen you run rig add, it downloads and installs R without removing previous versions. This is different from downloading R directly from CRAN, which typically overwrites your existing installation.\n\n\n\n\n6.2.3 Setting R Version Per Project\nFor reproducibility, you can lock a specific R version to a project so that Positron always uses it, regardless of your system default. Add this to .vscode/settings.json in your project:\n\nmacOS (Apple Silicon)macOS (Intel)Windows\n\n\n{\n  \"r.rpath.mac\": \"/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.4-arm64/Resources/bin/R\"\n}\n\n\n{\n  \"r.rpath.mac\": \"/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.4-x86_64/Resources/bin/R\"\n}\n\n\n{\n  \"r.rpath.windows\": \"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\R\\\\R-4.4.0\\\\bin\\\\R.exe\"\n}\n\n\n\nYou can also set this interactively: open the Command Palette in Positron (Cmd+Shift+P / Ctrl+Shift+P) and select R: Select R Binary.

    "section": "6.4 Core R Packages",
    "text": "6.4 Core R Packages\n\n6.4.1 The tidyverse\nThe tidyverse is a collection of R packages that share a common design philosophy centered on “tidy data”—rectangular data where each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each value is a cell. This simple principle, combined with a consistent and expressive syntax, has made the tidyverse the standard toolkit for data analysis in R.\nWhat makes the tidyverse transformative is that it provides a unified grammar for the entire data analysis pipeline: importing data, reshaping it, transforming it, visualizing it, and communicating results. The packages are designed to work together seamlessly, with consistent naming conventions and compatible data structures. Code written in tidyverse style tends to be readable and self-documenting—you can often understand what a pipeline does just by reading it.\nThe tidyverse occupies the same role in R that pandas does in Python: both represent the modern, dataframe-centric approach to data manipulation. While they developed somewhat independently (pandas emerged around 2008, dplyr in 2014), they share the philosophy that most data analysis tasks involve filtering rows, selecting columns, creating new variables, grouping, and summarizing. If you learn one well, the concepts transfer to the other.\nThe core tidyverse packages are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackage\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\ndplyr\nData manipulation: filter rows, select columns, create new variables, summarize, join tables\n\n\nggplot2\nVisualization using the grammar of graphics\n\n\ntidyr\nReshape data: pivot between wide and long formats\n\n\nreadr\nFast, consistent data import (read_csv, read_tsv, etc.)\n\n\npurrr\nFunctional programming: apply functions across lists and vectors\n\n\nstringr\nString manipulation with consistent syntax\n\n\n\nLoading the tidyverse meta-package loads all of these at once:\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipLearning the tidyverse\n\n\n\nThis guide assumes basic familiarity with tidyverse syntax. If you’re new to R or transitioning from base R, work through R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund. It’s the definitive resource for learning modern R workflows.\n\n\n\n\n6.4.2 Other Essential Packages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackage\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nhere\nBuild file paths relative to the project root—essential for reproducible scripts\n\n\nknitr\nRequired for rendering Quarto documents with R code",

    "section": "6.5 Bioconductor",
    "text": "6.5 Bioconductor\nBioconductor is a specialized repository of R packages for bioinformatics and computational biology. It’s separate from CRAN and has its own installation system, release schedule, and quality standards. If you’re doing genomics, transcriptomics, or single-cell analysis in R, you’ll use Bioconductor packages extensively.\n\n6.5.1 What Makes Bioconductor Different\nCurated and reviewed: Packages undergo technical review before acceptance and must meet documentation and testing standards.\nCoordinated releases: All Bioconductor packages are released together twice per year, tested against each other for compatibility.\nSpecialized data structures: Bioconductor defines standard classes for genomic data (SummarizedExperiment, SingleCellExperiment, etc.) that packages use consistently.\nTied to R versions: Each Bioconductor release requires a specific R version. This is important for reproducibility.\n\n\n6.5.2 Installing Bioconductor Packages\nBioconductor packages are installed via BiocManager, not install.packages():\n# First, install BiocManager (only once)\ninstall.packages(\"BiocManager\")\n\n# Then install Bioconductor packages\nBiocManager::install(\"DESeq2\")\nBiocManager::install(c(\"limma\", \"edgeR\", \"tximport\"))\n\n# Don't forget to snapshot\nrenv::snapshot()\nrenv automatically detects Bioconductor packages and records them correctly in the lockfile.\n\n\n6.5.3 Bioconductor Version Synchronization\nBioconductor versions are tied to R versions:\n\n\n\nBioconductor\nR Version\nRelease Date\n\n\n\n\n3.18\nR 4.3.x\nOct 2023\n\n\n3.19\nR 4.4.x\nMay 2024\n\n\n3.20\nR 4.4.x\nOct 2024\n\n\n3.21\nR 4.5.x\nMay 2025\n\n\n\nWhy this matters: If you developed an analysis with R 4.3 and Bioconductor 3.18, a collaborator with R 4.4 will get Bioconductor 3.19 or 3.20—potentially with different package behaviors. For critical analyses, pin the R version in your project settings (see Setting R Version Per Project above).\nCheck your current Bioconductor version:\nBiocManager::version()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBioconductor and renv\n\n\n\nWhen you use renv, the Bioconductor version is recorded in renv.lock along with package versions. Running renv::restore() on a new machine will install packages from the same Bioconductor release, helping ensure reproducibility.\n\n\n\n\n6.5.4 RNA-seq Analysis Packages\nThese packages form the core toolkit for bulk RNA-seq differential expression analysis:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackage\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nDESeq2\nDifferential expression using negative binomial generalized linear models. The most widely used method.\n\n\nlimma\nLinear models for differential expression. Includes voom for RNA-seq count data. Fast and flexible.\n\n\nedgeR\nDifferential expression using empirical Bayes estimation. Similar approach to DESeq2.\n\n\ntximport\nImport transcript-level quantifications from Salmon, kallisto, or RSEM into gene-level counts.\n\n\ntximeta\nLike tximport but automatically attaches metadata about the reference transcriptome.\n\n\ngoseq\nGene Ontology enrichment analysis that accounts for gene length bias in RNA-seq data.\n\n\n\nA typical RNA-seq analysis workflow uses tximport or tximeta to import quantifications, then DESeq2 (or limma/edgeR) for differential expression, then goseq for pathway analysis.\n\n\n6.5.5 Single-Cell Analysis Packages\nSingle-cell RNA-seq requires specialized methods. These are the main packages:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackage\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nSeurat\nComprehensive toolkit for single-cell analysis: QC, normalization, clustering, visualization, integration across datasets. The most popular choice.\n\n\nSingleCellExperiment\nBioconductor’s standard data structure for single-cell data. Many packages use this format.\n\n\nscran\nNormalization (pooling-based), feature selection, and clustering methods from the Bioconductor ecosystem.\n\n\nscater\nQuality control, visualization, and preprocessing. Works with SingleCellExperiment objects.\n\n\nMonocle3\nTrajectory analysis and pseudotime inference—modeling how cells transition between states.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteSeurat vs. Bioconductor ecosystem\n\n\n\nSeurat is the most popular single-cell package but isn’t part of Bioconductor—it’s on CRAN (and GitHub). The Bioconductor single-cell packages (SingleCellExperiment, scran, scater) form an alternative ecosystem. Many workflows use both: Seurat for analysis and visualization, with conversion to SingleCellExperiment when needed for specific Bioconductor tools.",

    "text": "7.1 Why Quarto?\nQuarto is a scientific publishing system that lets you combine code, results, and narrative text in a single document. You write analysis scripts as .qmd files—plain text with embedded R or Python code—and Quarto renders them into polished HTML reports with your outputs automatically included.\nIn the Musser Lab, Quarto documents are the standard format for data analysis because they solve a fundamental problem: keeping your code, your results, and your explanation of those results in sync. When you render a .qmd file, Quarto executes the code fresh and weaves the outputs into the document, so the report always reflects the actual analysis.",

    "text": "7.1.1 Compared to Plain R Scripts\nA plain .R script is just code. It can produce outputs, but there’s no built-in way to document what the code does, why you made certain choices, or what the results mean. When you share a script, collaborators see the code but not your interpretation.\nWith Quarto:\n\nCode and narrative live together — explain what you’re doing as you do it\nResults are embedded — figures and tables appear in the document\nOutput is shareable — render to HTML that anyone can open in a browser\n\n\n\n7.1.2 Compared to R Markdown\nIf you’ve used R Markdown (.Rmd), Quarto will feel familiar. The core idea—mixing code, results, and narrative—is the same. Quarto is R Markdown’s successor, developed by Posit (the company behind RStudio) as a unified system that works equally well with R, Python, Julia, and other languages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR Markdown\nQuarto\n\n\n\n\nFile extension\n.Rmd\n.qmd\n\n\nLanguage support\nR-centric (Python possible but awkward)\nMulti-language by design\n\n\nChunk options\n{r, echo=FALSE}\n#| echo: false (YAML-style)\n\n\nOutput formats\nDocuments, some websites\nDocuments, websites, books, slides, dashboards\n\n\n\nYou don’t need to memorize the differences. If you know R Markdown, Quarto works similarly. If you’re new to both, just learn Quarto—it’s the modern standard.\n\n\n7.1.3 What Else Can Quarto Do?\nWhile we primarily use Quarto for analysis scripts, it’s a general-purpose publishing system. This book was built with Quarto. You can also create:\n\nWebsites — project documentation, lab websites\nPresentations — slides rendered from code (RevealJS format)\nDashboards — interactive displays of data\n\nSee the Quarto documentation if you want to explore these formats.",

    "section": "7.2 The Interactive Development Workflow",
    "text": "7.2 The Interactive Development Workflow\nBefore diving into syntax, understand how you’ll actually work with Quarto documents. The workflow has two modes:\n\n7.2.1 Interactive Development\nMost of your time is spent running code interactively—executing chunks one at a time, inspecting results, and iterating. This is exploratory work:\n\nWrite a chunk of code in your .qmd file\nRun it with Cmd+Enter (macOS) or Ctrl+Enter (Windows)\nInspect the output in the Console, Variables pane, or Data Viewer\nIterate — modify the code, run again, check results\nMove on to the next chunk when satisfied\n\nDuring interactive development, you’re using Positron like an enhanced REPL. The .qmd file is your scratch pad. Objects you create persist in your R or Python session, so you can build on previous chunks.\n[TODO: screenshot of Positron with .qmd open, console showing output, Data Viewer with dataframe]\n\n\n7.2.2 Rendering\nWhen the analysis is complete—or when you want to share it—you render the document:\nquarto render my_analysis.qmd\nRendering executes every code chunk in a fresh session (no leftover objects from interactive work) and produces a standalone HTML file. This catches errors you might miss interactively, like relying on an object you created manually but forgot to include in the script.\nThe key insight: Interactive mode is for development. Rendering is for validation and sharing. Always render before committing or sending a report to someone.\n\n\n7.2.3 A Typical Session\nHere’s what a working session looks like:\n\nOpen your project in Positron\nOpen or create a .qmd file\nWrite the setup chunk (libraries, paths)\nRun it interactively to confirm packages load\nWrite a data-loading chunk, run it, inspect the data in Data Viewer\nWrite analysis chunks one at a time, running and checking each\nWhen complete, render the full document\nFix any errors that appear during render (usually missing objects or packages)\nCommit the .qmd file (and optionally the rendered HTML)\n\nThis interactive-then-render workflow is why Quarto documents are more reliable than scripts you only ever run interactively.",

Each commit has a unique ID (like a1b2c3d), a message describing what changed, and a pointer to the previous commit. Commits form a chain—your project’s history.\n\nStaging area\n\nA holding area for changes you want to include in your next commit. You “stage” files with git add, then “commit” them with git commit. This two-step process lets you commit only some of your changes.\n\nBranch\n\nA parallel version of your project. The default branch is called main. You can create other branches to experiment without affecting main, then merge them back when ready.\n\nRemote\n\nA copy of your repository on another server—typically GitHub. Your local repo and the remote stay in sync through push (upload your commits) and pull (download others’ commits).",

Check what’s changed: git status\nRun this constantly. It shows: - Which files you’ve modified - Which files are staged for commit - Which files Git isn’t tracking\ngit status\nExample output:\nOn branch main\nChanges not staged for commit:\n  modified:   scripts/01_import_qc.qmd\n\nUntracked files:\n  scripts/02_normalize.qmd\nThis tells you: you modified one file and created a new one. Neither is staged yet.\n\n\n9.6.2 2. See exactly what changed: git diff\nBefore committing, review your changes:\ngit diff                    # Show unstaged changes\ngit diff --staged           # Show staged changes (what will be committed)\ngit diff scripts/01_qc.qmd  # Show changes in a specific file\nLines starting with + were added; lines starting with - were removed.\n\n\n9.6.3 3.

Commit: git commit\nA commit saves your staged changes with a message explaining what you did:\ngit commit -m \"Add QC filtering step to remove low-quality samples\"\nThe message is important—it’s the record of what you did and why. Write messages that help future-you understand the change.\n\n\n9.6.5 5. Push to GitHub: git push\nUpload your commits to GitHub:\ngit push\nUntil you push, your commits exist only on your computer. Push regularly to back up your work.\n\n\n9.6.6 6.

Branches are most useful when:\n\nExperimenting: You want to try something that might not work\nMajor changes: You’re restructuring code and want a safe fallback\nCollaboration: Multiple people working on the same project\nCode review: You want someone to review changes before merging\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteDon’t overcomplicate it\n\n\n\nIf you’re working alone on an analysis and making incremental progress, committing to main is fine. Branches are a tool—use them when they help, skip them when they don’t.",

If something's missing, update your `.claude/CLAUDE.md`.\n\n## Example: Real Project Configuration\n\nHere's an example from a genomics analysis project:\n\n```markdown\n# Project: Sponge Cell Atlas\n\n## Overview\n\nSingle-cell RNA-seq analysis of *Ephydatia muelleri* (freshwater sponge).\nGoal: identify cell types and marker genes.\n\n## Environment\n\n- Python: `conda activate sponge-atlas`\n- R: renv (Seurat 5.0, auto-activates)\n\n## Data\n\n- `data/raw/counts.h5ad` — AnnData object, 15,000 cells × 12,000 genes\n- `data/raw/metadata.csv` — Sample metadata (batch, condition)\n- Cell type annotations in `obs['cell_type']` (preliminary, needs refinement)\n\n## Analysis Scripts\n\n| Script | Purpose | Status |\n|--------|---------|--------|\n| `analysis/01_qc.qmd` | Quality control, filtering | Complete |\n| `analysis/02_clustering.qmd` | Dimensionality reduction, clustering | Complete |\n| `analysis/03_markers.qmd` | Marker gene identification | In progress |\n| `analysis/04_figures.qmd` | Publication figures | Not started |\n\n## Conventions\n\n- Use Seurat naming conventions (e.g., `FindMarkers`, not `find_markers`)\n- Cluster colors defined in `scripts/colors.R`\n- All figures 300 DPI, max 7 inches wide\n\n## Notes\n\n- Batch effect between samples 1-3 and 4-6; already corrected with Harmony\n- Cluster 7 is likely doublets—exclude from marker analysis",
