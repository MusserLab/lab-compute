# Welcome {.unnumbered}

This guide teaches reproducible, collaborative data analysis workflows for the Musser Lab. Most lab projects use **both R and Python**: R is often best for statistical analysis, plotting, and many important legacy packages used for RNA sequencing and proteomic analysis (e.g. Seurat, DESeq2, and limma); Python is often best for automating analysis pipelines (including in bash), manipulating files, working with sequences and strings, and a growing number of RNAseq data analysis libraries (e.g. Scanpy, metacell) and plotting libraries (e.g. Matplotlib). The goal of this guide is to help you set up a standard workflow for creating computational projects that are **well-managed, documented, collaborative, and reproducible**.

The lab's standard toolchain is:

- **Positron** — the IDE/workspace where we develop and run R + Python
- **Conda** — Python environment management (Python version + packages)
- **Rig & renv** — R installation and package management
- **Git & GitHub** — version control, collaboration, and backup
- **Claude Code** — optional AI-assisted coding (useful, but never required)

## By the end of your first week

You should be able to:

1. Open a lab analysis folder in Positron and understand what "the project" is (it's the folder)
2. Create and activate a **conda environment** for Python and a **renv environment** for R in the same project
3. Write a Quarto script (.qmd) with a small R chunk and render it into an HTML report.
4. Commit and push changes to GitHub, including environment lockfiles when relevant
5. Diagnose the most common setup issues (wrong interpreter/kernel, missing packages, PATH problems)

### The key idea
We treat an analysis as a portable object:
**(code + environment definitions + instructions)**
A collaborator should be able to clone the repo, recreate the environments, and reproduce outputs.

## RStudio → Positron translation {#rstudio-positron-translation}

If you're used to RStudio, here are the key conceptual shifts:

| RStudio concept | Positron concept | What changes? |
|---|---|---|
| "Project" (.Rproj) | **Open Folder / Workspace** | The folder is the unit of work; you open it as a workspace. |
| R console | R console | Still an R process, but integrated with a broader editor/terminal model. |
| Python integration | Python interpreter + (sometimes) **kernel** | You must be explicit about which Python environment is used for scripts/notebooks. |
| R package library | `renv` | Packages are pinned per project; do not rely on global R libraries. |
| "Environment pane" | variable viewers + terminal + notebooks | Different UI, same goals. |

## Lab norms

- **One project, one publication** Think of projects as the computational infrastructure for one publication.
- **Never install packages into the base conda environment.** Create a conda environment specific to the project.
- **Every project has both**: a conda environment definition (for Python) and an renv lockfile (for R), unless explicitly documented otherwise.
- If you change dependencies (e.g. installing new R packages), **commit the lockfile(s)** with your other changes (`environment.yml` / `renv.lock`).
- Keep git repositories lightweight: **avoid large raw data or output plots in git** unless it's deliberately small demo data.
- Every project has a **README**: what it is, how to run it, where outputs go.

## Who This Guide Is For

This guide is for lab members with basic programming experience (often RStudio-based) who want professional workflows for reproducible analysis and collaboration. You do not need prior expertise with conda, renv, or Git—this guide is designed to get you to "operational competence."

## How to Use This Guide

Start with **Part 1: Quick Start**. You'll install tools and build a small first project that demonstrates the standard lab setup (Positron + conda + renv + Git/GitHub).

Then:

- Use **Part 2: Core Tools** as reference when you need to understand a tool or troubleshoot it.
- Use **Part 3: Workflows** for checklists (starting a project, collaborating, reproducibility, troubleshooting).

Suggested reading order for most new lab members:

1. Quick Start → Installation
2. Quick Start → Your First Project
3. Core Tools → Positron
4. Core Tools → Conda and renv
5. Core Tools → Git & GitHub
6. Core Tools - Claude Code

## The Philosophy

We emphasize:

1. **Reproducibility** — analysis runs should be easy to reproduce and share
2. **Environment isolation** — library/package dependencies are explicit and project-specific
3. **Version control** — changes are tracked, reviewable, and reversible
4. **AI assistance** — accelerate analysis, manage project goals, automate git, but **verify outputs**

If you remember one idea: **make analyses easy to reproduce for someone else.**
