# Welcome {.unnumbered}

This guide teaches you how to perform computational analysis using a modern, reproducible workflow. You'll learn to use:

- **Positron** — A powerful IDE designed for data science
- **Conda** — Environment management for Python
- **renv** — Package management for R
- **Git & GitHub** — Version control and collaboration
- **Claude Code** — AI-assisted coding

## Who This Guide Is For

This guide is written for students and researchers who have some programming experience but want to learn professional workflows for computational analysis. You should be comfortable with basic R or Python syntax, but don't need prior experience with the specific tools covered here.

## How to Use This Guide

**If you're new**, start with [Part 1: Quick Start](part1/intro.qmd). You'll install all the tools and create your first project in about 30 minutes.

**If you need a reference**, jump to [Part 2: Core Tools](part2/positron.qmd) for detailed coverage of each tool.

**If you're looking for workflows**, see [Part 3: Workflows](part3/starting-project.qmd) for task-oriented guides.

## The Philosophy

We emphasize:

1. **Reproducibility** — Your analyses should run on any machine
2. **Version control** — Track changes and collaborate effectively
3. **Environment isolation** — Each project has its own dependencies
4. **AI assistance** — Use modern tools to accelerate your work

Let's get started.
