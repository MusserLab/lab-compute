## Immediate Next Steps

- [ ] Add screenshots throughout (marked with `[TODO: screenshot]`)
- [ ] Review Quick Start section for clarity and completeness
- [ ] Test installation instructions on a fresh machine (macOS and Windows)
- [ ] Have a student test the Quick Start walkthrough

## Content to Expand

### Part 1: Quick Start
- [ ] Review `first-project.qmd` — ensure all steps work end-to-end

### Part 2: Core Tools
- [ ] **Positron**: Add more screenshots of key features
- [ ] **Conda**: Consider adding section on mamba for faster installs
- [ ] **renv**: Add troubleshooting for common Bioconductor issues
- [ ] **Git/GitHub**: Add section on GitHub Classroom (if using for courses)
- [ ] **Claude Code**: Add examples from real lab workflows

### Part 3: Workflows
- [ ] **Starting Project**: Add template repo link once created
- [ ] **Collaborating**: Add section on code review practices
- [ ] **Reproducibility**: Consider adding Docker basics
- [ ] **Troubleshooting**: Collect common student questions and add answers

### Appendices
- [ ] Add lab-specific templates
- [ ] Add links to external resources

## Ideas for Future Chapters

- [ ] Working with HPC/cluster computing
- [ ] Quarto documents and reports
- [ ] Data management best practices
- [ ] Common bioinformatics workflows

## Screenshots Needed

- [ ] Positron interface overview (labeled panes)
- [ ] Positron Data Viewer
- [ ] Positron with R and Python sessions
- [ ] GitHub repo creation
- [ ] GitHub Pages settings
- [ ] Claude Code session example
