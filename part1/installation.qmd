# Installation

This chapter walks you through installing all the tools you need. Follow the sections in order.

## 1. Positron

Positron is a data science IDE (integrated development environment) built by the makers of RStudio. It combines the best features of RStudio—like an integrated data viewer, variable explorer, and plot pane—with the modern editing experience of VS Code. Unlike RStudio, Positron treats both R and Python equally, making it ideal for labs that work in both languages. It's also highly extensible, with access to the full set of VS Code extensions, including claude code.

### macOS

1. Download Positron from [https://positron.posit.co](https://positron.posit.co)
2. Open the `.dmg` file and drag Positron to your Applications folder
3. Open Positron from Applications

### Windows

1. Download Positron from [https://positron.posit.co](https://positron.posit.co)
2. Run the installer (`.exe` file)
3. Follow the installation prompts
4. Launch Positron from the Start menu

::: {.callout-tip}
## First Launch
When you first open Positron, it may ask to install recommended extensions. Accept these defaults.
:::

## 2. Conda (Miniforge)

Conda is a package and environment manager that handles Python installations and their dependencies. The key feature is *environments*: isolated spaces where you can install specific versions of Python and packages for a specific project without affecting other projects. This prevents the common problem of upgrading a package for one project and breaking another. We use Miniforge, a community-driven conda distribution that defaults to the conda-forge channel—a large, well-maintained repository of python packages. Miniforge is lightweight and free to use in any context, unlike some commercial conda distributions.

### macOS

Open Terminal and run:

```bash
# Download the installer
curl -L -O "https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-MacOSX-$(uname -m).sh"

# Run the installer
bash Miniforge3-MacOSX-$(uname -m).sh
```

Follow the prompts, accepting the defaults. When asked about initializing conda, say **yes**.

After installation, restart your terminal or run:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
conda --version
```

### Windows

1. Download the Miniforge installer from [https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases)
   - Choose `Miniforge3-Windows-x86_64.exe`
2. Run the installer
3. Check "Add Miniforge3 to my PATH environment variable" during installation
4. Complete the installation

Open a **new** PowerShell window and verify:

```powershell
conda --version
```

Then initialize conda for your shell (this is required to make `conda activate` work):

```powershell
conda init powershell
```

**Close and reopen PowerShell** after running this command. You only need to do this once.

::: {.callout-note}
## Command Prompt Users
If you use Command Prompt instead of PowerShell, run `conda init cmd.exe` instead.
:::

## 3. R (using rig)

We install R using **rig** (R Installation Manager) rather than downloading directly from CRAN. Rig makes it easy to install R, switch between R versions, and keep R updated, all from the command line. Most importantly, it installs new R versions without overwriting or deleting previous versions, a common problem encountered when installing precompiled packages from the main R website. This is especially useful when you want to install the newest version of R to use with a new project while still maintaining older versions associated with older projects.

### macOS

1. Download the latest rig installer from [https://github.com/r-lib/rig/releases](https://github.com/r-lib/rig/releases)
   - Choose the `.pkg` file (e.g., `rig-macos-arm64.pkg` for Apple Silicon or `rig-macos-x86_64.pkg` for Intel Macs)
2. Double-click the `.pkg` file and follow the installation prompts

Then install the latest R version:

```bash
rig add release
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
R --version
```

::: {.callout-tip}
## rig Commands
- `rig list` — See installed R versions
- `rig add release` — Install latest stable R
- `rig add devel` — Install development version
- `rig default <version>` — Set default R version
:::

### Windows

1. Download the rig installer from [https://github.com/r-lib/rig/releases](https://github.com/r-lib/rig/releases)
   - Choose `rig-windows-latest.exe`
2. Run the installer
3. Open a **new** PowerShell window and install R:

```powershell
rig add release
```

4. Verify:

```powershell
R --version
```

### Why rig?

- **Easy updates**: `rig add release` always gets the latest version
- **Multiple versions**: Install R 4.3 and R 4.4 side by side for testing
- **Consistent**: Same commands on macOS and Windows

## 4. Git

Git is a version control system that tracks changes to your code over time. Think of it as an unlimited undo history that also lets you see *what* changed, *when*, and *why*. More importantly, Git enables collaboration - multiple people can work on the same project without overwriting each other's work. Every serious software project uses Git, and increasingly, so do data analysis projects. Learning Git is an investment that pays off throughout your career.

### macOS

Git may already be installed. Check by running:

```bash
git --version
```

If not installed, you'll be prompted to install the Xcode Command Line Tools. Accept the prompt.

Alternatively, install via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install git
```

### Windows

1. Download Git from [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
2. Run the installer
3. Accept the default options (the defaults are good)
4. Verify in a new terminal:

```powershell
git --version
```

### Configure Git (Both Platforms)

Set your identity (use your real name and email):

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

## 5. GitHub Account

GitHub is a web platform that hosts Git repositories in the cloud. It's where you'll store your code, collaborate with others, and share your work publicly or privately. GitHub adds features on top of Git—like issue tracking, pull requests for code review, and GitHub Pages for hosting websites. Most open-source software lives on GitHub, including the R and Python packages you use daily. If you don't have an individual GitHub account, please make one for yourself. We also maintain a [Lab Github Team](https://github.com/MusserLab) where we keep all lab code projects (including individual student projects). 

1. Go to [https://github.com](https://github.com) and create an account if you don't have one
2. We'll set up authentication in @sec-github-auth
3. Give Jake your account username so he can give you access to the Lab Github organization.

## 6. Claude Code

Claude Code is an AI coding assistant that runs in your terminal or integrates into Positron. Unlike chat-based AI tools, Claude Code can read and write files in your project, run commands, and help you build and debug code interactively. It understands context from your entire codebase, making it useful for everything from writing code, explaining unfamiliar code, debugging errors, and planning and tracking larger projects. Think of it as a knowledgeable collaborator who's always available and can work in the background.

### Prerequisites

You need Node.js 18+ installed:

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install node
```

**Windows:**
Download and install from [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) (LTS version).

### Install Claude Code

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

### Authenticate

Run Claude Code once to authenticate:

```bash
claude
```

Follow the prompts to log in with your Anthropic account.

::: {.callout-note}
## Anthropic Account
You'll need an Anthropic account with API access. If you're a lab member, ask for credentials.

## 7. Quarto (Optional)

Quarto is a scientific publishing system that lets you combine code, results, and narrative text in a single document. You write in Markdown with embedded R or Python code chunks, and Quarto renders it to HTML, PDF, Word, or other formats—with your code output automatically included. This is the modern approach to reproducible research: your analysis and your report are the same document, so results stay in sync with the code that produced them. Quarto can also make books, websites, presentations, and other types of documents. In fact, this book was built with Quarto!

### macOS

```bash
brew install quarto
```

Or download from [https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)

### Windows

Download and run the installer from [https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)

## Verification Checklist

Run these commands to verify everything is installed:

```bash
# Check each tool
positron --version  # Or just open Positron
conda --version
R --version
git --version
claude --version
quarto --version    # If installed
```

All commands should return version numbers without errors.

::: {.callout-claude title="Ask Claude"}
**Verify your setup:**

> I just installed R, conda, and git. Here's what I get when I run the version commands:
>
> [paste your output]
>
> Does this look right, or is something misconfigured?

*Claude can check that paths are correct, versions are compatible, and flag common installation issues.*
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
## Troubleshooting
If any command fails with "command not found":

- **macOS**: Try opening a new terminal window
- **Windows**: Try opening a new PowerShell window
- Check that the tool's install directory is in your PATH

See [Troubleshooting](../part3/troubleshooting.qmd) for common issues.
