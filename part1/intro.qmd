# Introduction

## What We're Going to Do

In Part 1, you're going to install a few tools and then run a real single-cell RNA-seq analysis — loading a count matrix, filtering and normalizing the data, clustering cells, and generating a UMAP visualization. You'll do all of this interactively in Positron, our lab's IDE, writing your analysis in a Quarto document that doubles as a shareable report.

Along the way, you'll learn to use the features of Positron that you'll rely on every day: the file explorer for navigating your project, the console for running code interactively, the environment pane for inspecting your data, the plots pane for viewing figures, and the terminal for running commands.

By the end, you'll have a working project with a rendered HTML report that you could share with anyone in the lab. That's the starting point for every analysis you'll do here.

## How We Work in the Lab

Most analysis in the Musser Lab is written in **Quarto documents** (`.qmd` files). A Quarto document is both a script and a report: you write code and explanatory text together in one file, and when you render it, Quarto runs all the code and produces a clean HTML (or PDF) document with your results, figures, and narrative included. This means your analysis and your documentation are always in sync — there's no separate step of copying figures into a report or updating numbers by hand.

Our projects typically use both **R and Python**, though usually one language per script. R is the go-to for statistical analysis, plotting, and the many well-established bioinformatics packages (Seurat, DESeq2, limma). Python is used for automation, file manipulation, working with sequences, and an expanding set of analysis tools (Scanpy, metacell). Positron handles both languages equally well, so you can switch between them as needed.

## The Tools

Here's a quick overview of the tools you'll encounter in this guide and how they fit together. You don't need to understand all of this now — you'll learn each tool as you need it.

```

**Positron** is your home base — the application where you write code, explore data, view plots, and manage your project files. It's built by the makers of RStudio but designed for both R and Python.

**Conda** and **renv** are environment managers. They keep track of which packages (and which versions) each project uses, so your analysis works the same way on any computer. Conda handles Python; renv handles R. You'll set up renv in your first project and learn conda later in Part 2.

**Git and GitHub** let you track changes to your code over time and share it with collaborators. Think of Git as an unlimited undo history for your project, and GitHub as the place where that history lives online. You'll learn these in Part 2.

**Claude Code** is an AI coding assistant that integrates into Positron. It can help you write code, debug errors, explain unfamiliar functions, and plan analyses. You'll install it in the next chapter and see it in action throughout the guide.

## What You'll Learn in Part 1

After working through the next two chapters, you will have:

- Installed Positron, R, Quarto, and Claude Code
- Created a project with a proper folder structure
- Run a complete single-cell analysis interactively in Positron, learning the IDE along the way
- Rendered your analysis into a self-contained HTML report
- Used renv to manage your R packages

That's enough to start working on real lab projects. Parts 2–4 will deepen your understanding of each tool and introduce version control, collaboration workflows, and more advanced techniques — but you can come back to those as you need them.

Let's start by installing the tools.
