# Introduction

## Why These Tools?

In the Musser Lab, most analyses are written as **self-contained Quarto scripts** (`.qmd`). A `.qmd` is both a *script* and a *publishable document*: it contains code, narrative, and the logic to render a shareable output (usually HTML).

This workflow supports how we actually work:

- We often use **both R and Python** across a project.
- Each analysis script clearly states what data it reads and what it produces.
- Scripts are designed to be readable, annotated, and reproducible for other lab members.

The toolchain in this guide exists to make `.qmd`-based analyses:

- **Reproducible** — same results on another machine
- **Collaborative** — easy to review and share
- **Maintainable** — clear provenance and version control

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Positron** | IDE designed for data science (R + Python) |
| **Conda** | Python environment management |
| **renv** | R package management |
| **Git/GitHub** | Version control and collaboration |
| **Claude Code** | AI-assisted coding and analysis |

### What "good" looks like

A typical analysis loop in the lab:

1. Open a project folder in Positron
2. Activate the project environments (conda for Python, renv for R)
3. Write a Quarto analysis script (`.qmd`) that loads data, runs analysis, and exports results
4. Render the script to HTML: `quarto render analysis/my_analysis.qmd`
5. Commit and push code + lockfiles (`environment.yml`, `renv.lock`) with Git

## How They Fit Together

```

**Positron** is where you write and run code and manage project files.

**Conda** defines a Python environment for the project (Python version + packages).

**renv** pins the R package set for the project.

**Git/GitHub** tracks changes to scripts, data-processing logic, and environment definitions.

**Claude Code** is optional; it can help write or debug code, but outputs must be verified.

### Key concepts

- **Quarto script (`.qmd`)**: the main analysis artifact in the lab; it renders to a shareable output (HTML/PDF).
- **Environment**: project-specific dependencies.
  - Python dependencies: conda (`environment.yml`)
  - R dependencies: renv (`renv.lock`)
- **Render**: convert `.qmd` → HTML/PDF, executing code in the process.
- **Interpreter/kernel selection**: Quarto and Positron must run the correct R and Python; this guide shows how to verify which ones are being used.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of Part 1, you will have:

1. Installed the core tools and verified they work
2. Opened a lab-style project folder in Positron
3. Set up project environments:
   - conda environment for Python
   - renv for R packages
4. Written a Quarto analysis script (`.qmd`) that:
   - states what it reads and what it produces
   - runs an analysis and generates a figure
   - renders to HTML
5. Put the project under version control and pushed it to GitHub

Next, we'll install tools and build your first Quarto-based analysis project.
