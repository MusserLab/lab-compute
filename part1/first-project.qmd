# Your First Project

Let's create a complete project that uses all the tools together. By the end, you'll have:

- A project folder with organized structure
- A conda environment for Python
- An R project with renv
- Git version control
- Code you wrote with Claude Code's help

## Step 1: Create the Project Folder

Open your terminal and create a new project:

```bash
# Navigate to where you keep projects
cd ~/Documents  # or wherever you prefer

# Create and enter the project folder
mkdir my-first-analysis
cd my-first-analysis
```

## Step 2: Open in Positron

Open Positron and use **File → Open Folder** to open `my-first-analysis`.

[TODO: screenshot of Positron with empty folder open]

## Step 3: Initialize Git

In Positron's terminal (View → Terminal), initialize a Git repository:

```bash
git init
```

Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude files that shouldn't be tracked:

```bash
# Create .gitignore
cat > .gitignore << 'EOF'
# R
.Rhistory
.RData
.Rproj.user/
renv/library/
renv/staging/

# Python
__pycache__/
*.pyc
.conda/
.venv/

# Data (large files)
data/raw/

# OS files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# IDE
.vscode/
.positron/
EOF
```

## Step 4: Set Up Conda Environment

Create a conda environment for this project:

```bash
conda create -n my-first-analysis python=3.11 -y
conda activate my-first-analysis
```

Install some basic packages:

```bash
conda install pandas numpy matplotlib -y
```

Save the environment specification:

```bash
conda env export > environment.yml
```

::: {.callout-tip}
## Environment Activation
Every time you work on this project, activate the environment first:
```bash
conda activate my-first-analysis
```
:::

## Step 5: Set Up R with renv

In Positron's R console (or terminal running R), initialize renv:

```r
# Install renv if needed
install.packages("renv")

# Initialize renv for this project
renv::init()
```

This creates:
- `renv/` folder for package library
- `renv.lock` file tracking package versions
- `.Rprofile` to auto-activate renv

Install a package to test:

```r
install.packages("ggplot2")
renv::snapshot()  # Save the state
```

## Step 6: Create Project Structure

Create a standard folder structure:

```bash
mkdir -p data/raw data/processed scripts output
```

Your project now looks like:

```
my-first-analysis/
├── .git/
├── .gitignore
├── data/
│   ├── raw/          # Original data (not tracked)
│   └── processed/    # Cleaned data
├── scripts/          # Analysis scripts
├── output/           # Results, figures
├── environment.yml   # Conda environment
├── renv/             # R packages
└── renv.lock         # R package versions
```

## Step 7: Write Code with Claude Code

Now let's use Claude Code to help write some analysis code.

In the terminal, start Claude Code:

```bash
claude
```

Try asking it to create a simple analysis script:

> "Create a Python script in scripts/ that loads a CSV file, calculates summary statistics, and saves a plot"

Claude Code will:
1. Ask clarifying questions if needed
2. Write the code for you
3. Save it to the file

[TODO: screenshot of Claude Code interaction]

Do the same for R:

> "Create an R script in scripts/ that does similar analysis using tidyverse and ggplot2"

## Step 8: Make Your First Commit

Stage and commit your work:

```bash
# See what files are ready to commit
git status

# Add all files (except those in .gitignore)
git add .

# Make your first commit
git commit -m "Initial project setup with conda and renv"
```

## Step 9: Push to GitHub {#sec-github-auth}

### Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and click **New repository**
2. Name it `my-first-analysis`
3. Keep it private (or public if you prefer)
4. **Don't** initialize with README (we already have files)
5. Click **Create repository**

### Authenticate with GitHub

The easiest method is using the GitHub CLI:

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI
# macOS:
brew install gh

# Windows: Download from https://cli.github.com/

# Authenticate
gh auth login
```

Follow the prompts to authenticate via browser.

### Push Your Code

```bash
# Add the remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/my-first-analysis.git

# Push your code
git push -u origin main
```

## Congratulations!

You've created a complete project with:

- ✅ Organized folder structure
- ✅ Python environment (conda)
- ✅ R package management (renv)
- ✅ Version control (Git)
- ✅ Cloud backup (GitHub)
- ✅ AI-assisted code (Claude Code)

## What's Next?

- **Part 2** dives deeper into each tool
- **Part 3** covers common workflows like collaboration and reproducibility

When you return to this project later:

```bash
cd my-first-analysis
conda activate my-first-analysis
# R will auto-activate renv when you start it
positron .  # Or open Positron and navigate to the folder
```
