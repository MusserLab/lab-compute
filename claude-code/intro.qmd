# Introduction to Claude Code

Claude Code is an AI assistant that runs in your terminal and works directly with your files. Unlike web-based AI tools, it can read your code, edit files, and execute commands—all within the context of your project.

## What Claude Code Can Do

- **Write code** — Generate scripts, functions, and analyses
- **Edit files** — Modify existing code based on your instructions
- **Run commands** — Execute shell commands and see output
- **Search codebases** — Find files and patterns across projects
- **Explain code** — Help you understand complex or unfamiliar code
- **Debug** — Identify and fix errors

## When to Use Claude Code

Claude Code is particularly useful when you:

- Are starting a new analysis and want to scaffold the structure
- Need to write boilerplate code (data loading, standard plots)
- Are debugging an error you don't understand
- Want to refactor or clean up existing code
- Need to understand unfamiliar code in a project

## When Not to Use Claude Code

Claude Code is a tool, not a replacement for understanding your analysis:

- **Don't** blindly accept generated code without reviewing it
- **Don't** use it for tasks you need to deeply understand (learn the method first)
- **Don't** rely on it for domain-specific scientific decisions
- **Don't** assume it knows your data or experimental design

## Installation

See [Installation](../part1/installation.qmd#claude-code) for setup instructions.

## Starting a Session

Navigate to your project directory and start Claude Code:

```bash
cd ~/projects/my-analysis
claude
```

This opens an interactive session. Claude Code automatically reads any project configuration files (covered in the next chapter) to understand your project context.

## Basic Interactions

### Asking Questions

```
> What does the normalize_counts function do?
```

Claude Code will read the relevant file and explain the code.

### Writing Code

```
> Create an R script that loads data/counts.csv and calculates summary statistics by group
```

Claude Code will write the code and show you the result before saving.

### Editing Files

```
> In analysis.qmd, add a step that filters out samples with fewer than 1000 counts
```

Claude Code shows you the proposed changes and asks for confirmation.

### Running Commands

```
> Run quarto render on analysis.qmd and show me any errors
```

Claude Code executes the command and reports the output.

## Reviewing Changes

Claude Code always shows you what it plans to do before doing it:

- **File edits** — Shows a diff of proposed changes
- **New files** — Shows the content it will write
- **Commands** — Shows the command before running (for potentially destructive operations)

Review carefully before accepting. You can:

- Accept the change
- Ask for modifications
- Reject and try a different approach

## Ending a Session

Type `/exit` or press `Ctrl+C` to end the session.

## The Mental Model

Think of Claude Code as a capable assistant who:

- Can see and modify your project files
- Knows general programming patterns and best practices
- Reads your project configuration to understand context
- **Does not** inherently know your scientific domain or data
- **Does not** remember previous sessions (each session starts fresh)

Your job is to:

- Provide clear instructions
- Supply necessary context about your data and goals
- Review and verify all outputs
- Make scientific and analytical decisions

## Next Steps

The following chapters cover:

- **Project and User Files** — How to configure Claude Code for your projects
- **Skills** — Reusable instructions for common tasks
- **Session Walkthrough** — A complete example of using Claude Code in practice
