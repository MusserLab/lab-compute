# Getting Started with Claude Code

Claude Code is an AI assistant that works directly with your project files. Unlike web-based AI chat, it can read your code, edit files, run commands, and search across your codebase, all within the context of your project.

## Before You Start

If you followed the [Installation chapter](../part1/installation.qmd), you've already installed Claude Code, authenticated, and added the Positron extension. If you skipped that chapter or need a refresher, here's what you need:

1. **Node.js** installed ([nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org))
2. **Claude Code CLI** installed: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
3. **Authenticated**: run `claude` in your terminal once and log in with your Anthropic account
4. **Positron extension**: Extensions view → search "Claude Code" → Install

If any of those steps are unfamiliar, work through [Section 2.4](../part1/installation.qmd#claude-code) first.

## Using Claude Code in Positron

The easiest way to use Claude Code is through the Positron extension. This keeps your code, terminal, and AI assistant in one window.

**To open Claude Code in Positron:**

1. Open your project folder in Positron
2. Click the Claude Code icon in the left sidebar (or use `Cmd+Shift+P` → "Claude Code: Open")
3. Start typing in the chat panel

The extension automatically knows which project you're working in and can see your files.

**Key shortcuts:**

| Action | Shortcut |
|--------|----------|
| Submit message | `Enter` (or `Cmd+Enter` depending on settings) |
| New conversation | Click "+" or `Cmd+N` in the Claude panel |
| Reference a file | Type `@` and start typing the filename |

### Terminal Alternative

You can also run Claude Code directly in any terminal by navigating to your project directory and typing `claude`. This gives you the same capabilities as the extension — reading files, editing code, running commands — but in a terminal interface rather than a sidebar panel. Some people prefer this, especially for quick one-off questions or when working outside Positron.

## What Claude Code Can Do

| Capability | Examples |
|------------|----------|
| **Understand code** | Explain functions, trace data flow, find patterns |
| **Write code** | Create scripts, write functions, generate boilerplate |
| **Edit files** | Fix bugs, refactor, add features to existing files |
| **Run commands** | Execute R/Python scripts, git operations, quarto render |
| **Search** | Find where things are defined, grep for patterns |
| **Debug** | Trace errors, explain stack traces, suggest fixes |

## When to Use Claude Code

**Claude Code is helpful for:**

- Setting up project structure and boilerplate
- Debugging cryptic error messages
- Understanding unfamiliar code in a project
- Writing repetitive code (data loading, plotting templates)
- Troubleshooting environment issues (conda, renv, paths)
- Explaining what code does and how components connect

**Claude Code is not a replacement for:**

- Your analytical judgment (you decide normalization methods, thresholds, interpretations)
- Your domain expertise (you know biology, Claude knows code)
- Careful code review (always verify outputs, especially for statistics)
- Understanding methods you'll use repeatedly (learn them, don't just copy-paste)

### The division of labor
You bring the scientific knowledge and analytical decisions. Claude Code brings coding speed and pattern recognition. The combination is powerful, but you're always the one making the calls.

## The Mental Model

Three concepts help you work effectively with Claude Code:

### 1. Capable but not omniscient

Claude can write sophisticated code, but it doesn't automatically know:

- Your specific data structures and conventions
- Your project's history and past decisions
- What you've tried before and why it didn't work

**Solution:** Tell Claude what it needs to know. Be specific about your data, your goals, and any constraints.

### 2. Context matters

Claude only knows what's in your project folder and what you tell it. Each new conversation starts fresh—it doesn't remember yesterday's session.

**Solution:** Use project configuration files (covered in the next chapter) to give Claude persistent context about your project.

### 3. Verify, then trust

Claude often gets things right, but sometimes produces plausible-looking code with subtle bugs, especially for:

- Statistical methods it doesn't fully understand
- Edge cases in your specific data
- Domain-specific conventions it guesses at

**Solution:** Run the code and check the outputs. For analytical code, verify counts at each step and spot-check results.

## A Quick Example

Here's what a typical interaction looks like in Positron:

**You type:**
> I'm getting this error when I run the script:
>
> Error in `left_join()`: ! `by` must be supplied when `x` and `y` have no common variables.
>
> The join is on line 45 of analysis.qmd

**Claude responds:**
- Reads the relevant section of `analysis.qmd`
- Explains that the column names don't match between the two dataframes
- Shows you the column names in each
- Proposes a fix with the correct `by =` argument
- Asks if you want to apply the edit

You review the proposed change, accept it, and the file is updated.

## Reviewing Changes

Claude always shows you what it plans to do:

- **File edits** — Shows a diff with the proposed changes highlighted
- **New files** — Shows the full content before writing
- **Commands** — Shows the command before running it

You can:

- **Accept** the change
- **Ask for modifications** ("Can you also add error handling for empty files?")
- **Reject** and try a different approach ("Actually, let's do this a different way")

## Next Steps

Now that you understand what Claude Code can do, the following chapters cover:

- **Configuring Projects** — How to give Claude persistent context about your project
- **Skills** — Reusable instruction sets for common tasks
- **Working Effectively** — Patterns for productive Claude Code sessions
